This week in Unit 6 we have explored qualitative research methods.  You have all done a great job evaluating the qualitative studies on servant leadership.  Some of the articles were clearer than others.  Here is a short summary of the unique features of qualitative research methods:

<ol>
<li>Qualitative research has <b>three distinct purposes</b>: to describe, to explore and interpret, and to build theory.</li>
<li><strong>Qualitative designs</strong> tend to be more holistic, investigating unknown variables following flexible guidelines utilizing emergent methods in a highly context-bound, personal approach (Leedy &amp; Ormrod, 2010, p. 96).  Examples include: phenomenological, ethnography, case studies, grounded theory.</li>
<li>Qualitative research gathers <strong>textual or image-based data</strong> from typically <strong>small, informative samples</strong> using loosely structured or unstructured interviews or observations (Leedy &amp; Ormrod, 2010, p. 96).  Examples of qualitative data include from Anderson (2010) include:
<ul class="unordered">
<li>
<div>Audio recordings and transcripts from in-depth or semi-structured interviews</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>Structured interview questionnaires containing open ended comments.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>Audio recordings and transcripts from focus group sessions.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>Field notes (notes taken by the researcher while in the field [setting] being studied)</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>Video recordings</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>Case study notes</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>Images</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>Documents (reports, meeting minutes, e-mails)</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>Diaries, video diaries</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>Observation notes</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>Press clippings</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>Photographs</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Qualitative data is <strong>analysed with the goal uncovering themes and categories</strong>, with acknowledgement of potential researcher bias and subjectivity.</li>
<li>Qualitative research <strong>findings are typically reported in a narrative form</strong> (Leedy &amp; Ormrod, 2010, p. 96).</li>
</ol>

According to Anderson (2010, p.2), the strengths of qualitative research can be summarized as follows:

<ul class="unordered">
<li>
<div>Issues can be examined in detail and in depth.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>Interviews are not restricted to specific questions and can be guided/redirected by the researcher in real time.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>The research framework and direction can be quickly revised as new information emerges.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>The data based on human experience that is obtained is powerful and sometimes more compelling than quantitative data.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>Data usually are collected from a few cases or individuals so findings cannot be generalized to a larger population.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>Findings can however be transferable to another setting.</div>
</li>
</ul>

According to Anderson (2010, pp.2-3), the limitations of qualitative research can be summarized as follows:

<ul class="unordered">
<li>
<div>Research quality is heavily dependent on the individual skills of the researcher and more easily influenced by the researcher&#8217;s personal biases.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>Rigor is more difficult to maintain, assess, and demonstrate.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>The volume of data makes analysis and interpretation time consuming.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>It is sometimes not as well understood and accepted as quantitative research within the scientific community.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>The researcher&#8217;s presence during data gathering can affect the subjects&#8217; responses.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>Issues of anonymity and confidentiality can present problems when presenting findings.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>Findings can be more difficult and time consuming to characterize in a visual way.</div>
</li>
</ul>
