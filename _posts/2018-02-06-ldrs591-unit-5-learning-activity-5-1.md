The following is my review of the quantitative research design in the article titled: <em>Leader purposefulness within servant leadership, leader follower-focus, leader goal-orientation, and leader purposefulness in a large U.S. healthcare organization</em>, by (Irving &amp; Berndt, 2017).

&nbsp;

The review was performed by applying criteria provided in the book titled: <em>Understanding research, a consumer’s guide</em>, by (Plano-Clark &amp; Creswell, 2015, p. 211).

&nbsp;

<h5><strong>What quantitative research design was used and was it justified? </strong></h5>

<strong>Rating – 3/3</strong>

The study intent was to provide evidence that supports the claim that leader purposefulness (LP) should be included as a part of research and theories on servant leadership (SL). It examined the validity of the Purpose in Leadership Inventory (PLI) criterion, which helps in studying LP as an explicit dimension of SL.

To provide answers, the authors examined four leader independent variables and four dependent variables in order to find the relationship between dimensions of a leader’s SL focus and the effect of these dimensions on followers. In the course of their examination, they sought to predict the importance of each independent variable on the related dependent variables. They also gave special attention to the unique and incremental value of LP.

From the study intent, research question, and study method described above, it is evident that the authors sought to describe the relationship among variables. This, among others, makes it evident that a correlational research design was used. I found this design justified because while examining the relationship among variables, the authors also paid attention as to how LP could affect SL. This, I believe, was in line with the study intent.

&nbsp;

<h5><strong>Were good quantitative procedures used to select and assign participants?</strong></h5>

<strong>Rating – 2/3</strong>

The study showed that out of a possible population of 5000 who had equal opportunity to participate, over 1780 persons participated and only 1713, provided complete responses that could be used for most study analyses. It also showed that there was a good distribution among the age, level of education and duration of employment for followers who participated. As per the leaders, there was a good distribution in terms of their experience.

It was observed that although the study showed that the authors had no direct influence in selecting the participants, the study showed that 83% of the followers who participated were female, while 65% of the leaders accessed, were also female.

Based on the above, I felt the need to know (perhaps from other literature), what possible effects the sex of the participants could have on the results of the studies like this.

&nbsp;

<h5><strong>Were good quantitative data collection procedures used?</strong></h5>

<strong>Rating – 3/3</strong>

Absolutely yes! The data collection procedure allowed the respondents to provide anonymous feedback on the leader they assessed. Also, the participants had a duration of one month to provide their responses.

&nbsp;

<h5><strong>Did quantitative research design address the study’s purpose?</strong></h5>

<strong>Rating – 3/3</strong>

Absolutely! Discussion on the study findings thoroughly analysed and described the relationships among the variables tested. Where applicable, the authors also provided supporting literature as added evidence.
