Analysis of the relation between computational thinking skills and various variables with the structural equation model.

<strong>            </strong> Durak, Hatice Yildiz &amp; Saritepeci, Mustafa.

<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Literature Overview</strong></p>

<strong>            </strong>Authors Durak and Saritepeci analyzed various factors that might influence student development and academic advancement in areas of computational thinking. They viewed the idea of computational thinking as “abstraction, algorithmic thinking, problem-solving, decomposition, generalization, and debugging” (Durak &amp; Saritepeci, 2018. p. 192). In the article they plotted 11 hypotheses in relation to variables affecting students computational thinking skills. These variables are listed as:

<ul>
<li>H1 Sexes of students have a positive effect on their computational thinking skill levels.</li>
<li>H2 Education levels of students have a positive effect on their computational thinking skill levels.</li>
<li>H3 Students&#8217; experience of using IT has a positive effect on their computational thinking skill levels.</li>
<li>H4 Students&#8217; daily period of using the Internet has a positive effect on their computational thinking skill levels.</li>
<li>H5 Students&#8217; success in maths class positively affects their computational thinking skill levels.</li>
<li>H6 Students&#8217; attitude towards maths class positively affects their computational thinking skill levels.</li>
<li>H7 Students&#8217; success in Science class positively affects their computational thinking skill levels.</li>
<li>H8 Students&#8217; attitude towards science class positively affects their computational thinking skill levels.</li>
<li>H9 Students&#8217; success in Information technologies class positively affects their computational thinking skill levels.</li>
<li>H10 Students&#8217; attitude towards information technologies class positively affects their computational thinking skill levels.</li>
<li>H11 Students&#8217; ways of thinking have a positive effect on their computational thinking skill levels.</li>
</ul>

(Durak &amp; Saritepeci, 2018. p. 196)

<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Method</strong></p>

Durak and Saritepeci collected data at a variety of middle and high schools. The participants were both male and female ranging from grade 5 to 12. The participation in the research was voluntary and fairly even in regards to percentage of male and female. The data was primarily collected through three research tools: a Personal Information Form Questionnaire, a Computational Thinking Skills Scale, and a Thinking Ways Scale. The Personal Information Form Questionnaire defined variable applicable to each student. The computational thinking skills scale was developed by Korkmaz, Çakır, and €Ozden (2015). This scale assess Creativity, Algorithmic Thinking, Cooperation, Critical Thinking, and Problem Solving. The Thinking Ways Scale assesses students legislative, executive and judicial thinking skills (Durak &amp; Saritepeci, 2018. p. 197)

<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Results/Findings</strong></p>

The results were tested against a variety of statistical accuracy assessment methods such as RMSEA, NNFI, NFI, CFI and GFI and to be found accurate and acceptable. As to the hypotheses H 1,3,4,6,8,9,10 were rejected, H 2,5,7,11 were accepted as accurate variables that influence computational thinking. The results were significant in that there are many educators that uses many of the rejected variables as reasons students are not successful in computational thinking. The focus on math, science, level of education and ways of thinking can be used to develop better computational thinking skills.

<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Conclusions</strong></p>

Durak and Saritepeci have significant conclusions. Many variables such as time spent online daily, it usage in general, and gender, do not influence computational thinking skills. Computational thinking skills are most influenced by Math and Science class success, education level, and ways of thinking.

<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Personal comments</strong></p>

This was a great article that will be very helpful in my research topic. They have clearly outlined what computational thinking is. I plan on narrowing the topic even further to the topic of coding or as they view it algorithmic thinking and problem-solving,
