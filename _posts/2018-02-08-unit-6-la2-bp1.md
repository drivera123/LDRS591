<strong>What sampling strategy is used and is it appropriate and justified?</strong>

Chan &amp; So (2017) I believe use theory or concept sampling method in their article above. They are testing the concept of servant leadership characteristics and whether or not they can be taught through a community-based project class to secondary students.

<strong>Is the sample size appropriate?</strong>

The sample size appears adequately small. Plano-Clark &amp; Creswell (2015, p.349) call for small sample sizes to ensure researchers &#8220;can capture rich detail.&#8221; Chan &amp; So (2017)&#8217;s project class is made up of fourteen students aged between 15-17. When invited for three focus group interviews eleven participants took part.

<strong>Is the data collected appropriately?</strong>

Interviews were conducted using small focus groups. They were audio recorded and then transcripts were independently coded. The semi-structured format was chosen for the focus groups. Chan &amp; So (2017) state that this is insider research and that this was done to help promote familiarity and create an environment for openness in answering the focus group questions.

<strong>Are the data gathered ethically and thoughtfully?</strong>

Yes, it appears all data was collected appropriately. Permission was sought from participants parents due to their age. Also inter reliability was achieved through having two researchers analyze the transcripts. This practice fulfilled the ethical and substantive validity of this type of research. (Chan &amp; So, p. 21).
