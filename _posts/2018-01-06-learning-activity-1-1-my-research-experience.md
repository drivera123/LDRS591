<h3>My Research Experience:</h3>

After completing a Bachelor of Arts in History, I felt that I had a fair understanding of research methods and how worldview and bias can affect the process. While it is impossible to select participants to collect data from when dealing with an issue hundreds of years old, one has to sift through primary source material rather than gathering data in person. Collecting data from primary sources hundreds of years old has its own struggles and the ultimate challenge it to create an impartial view of the event or issue by understanding the biases and worldview of those documenting said event or issue. My current use of research typically falls in the early stage materials (Clark &amp; Creswell, 2015. p10), though I try to use journal articles and more rigorously grounded materials like handbooks and encyclopedia. I often focus more on qualitative research rather than quantitative, as my focus in my undergrad was often in the qualitative fields.

<h3>My Leadership Decision:</h3>

While developing a strategy for financially balancing the budget of the school I was working with, I utilized many sources to brainstorm ways to promote growth and financial stability. I spoke with other administrators including members of the Society of Christian Schools BC leadership team, I spoke with policy management professionals in the public school board, I read early stage materials on promotion, branding, and redesigning/restructuring business appearances. I evaluated the school&#8217;s values and vision and helped restate the vision through a series of decisions to renew the schools long term goals and priorities. My decision for the school needed to be supported by the board of trustees, with whom I met regularly during the planing process. Ultimately my decision had to fit within prior school policy and the school constitution as a charitable organization. With all of these structures and accountability in place, I was still able to provide several strategies to pull the school out of debt and into a fiscally prosperous situation.
