The following is my review of the participants and data collection in the article titled: <em>Leader purposefulness within servant leadership, leader follower-focus, leader goal-orientation, and leader purposefulness in a large U.S. healthcare organization</em>, by (Irving &amp; Berndt, 2017).

&nbsp;

I performed the review by applying criteria provided in the book titled: <em>Understanding research, a consumer’s guide</em>, by (Plano-Clark &amp; Creswell, 2015, p. 249).

<h5><strong>What sampling strategy was used and was it justified? </strong></h5>

<strong>Rating – 3/3</strong>

I gave a rating of 3 for the following reasons; first, the authors used random sampling strategy to select the sample participants from the population. Also, the site was an organization where servant leadership had been identified as an effective leadership approach. I believe this justified why random sampling was appropriate for the purpose of the study. Finally, the authors provided a detailed explanation about how the sampling procedure was administered in the study.

<strong> </strong>

<h5><strong>Was the sample size appropriate and justified?</strong></h5>

<strong>Rating – 2/3</strong>

The study showed that the sample size was large; over 1780 participated while 1713 complete the responses used for the study analyses. This suggests there was low sampling error. Given that a minimum sample size of 30 participants was needed for the correlational study, it is evident that the sample size is appropriate. Considering that the authors did not provide a sample size formula or power analysis, I concluded that the sample size was appropriate but not justified.

&nbsp;

<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Were good quality measures used to gather data, how did I know?</strong></h5>

<strong>Rating – 3/3</strong>

The study instrument was aimed at examining the relationship between servant leadership behaviours and the following variables; job satisfaction, follower organizational commitment, follower person-organization fit, and follower perception of leadership effectiveness. The nature of these variables required an attitudinal measure instrument type.

The research instruments were Irving’s Purpose in Leadership Inventory (PLI) and Irving’s explanatory factor analysis, which was applied to the PLI. Asides both being attitudinal measure instrument types that were developed quite recently, in 2014, the authors provided literature to support their validity; having being used in past studies. In furtherance to this, the authors reported that the reliability coefficient in the study as 0.98 – well above the standard of 0.7.

Based on the above, it is evident that high quality instruments and good measures were used to gather data.

&nbsp;

<h5><strong>Was the data gathered using ethical procedures?</strong></h5>

<strong>Rating – 2/3</strong>

Although the authors did not provide any mention or evidence of having obtained appropriate approvals and permissions, they reported having sent the invitation to participate, to around 5000 employees out of which, 1780 participants responded. Each participant was given one month to respond. This implies that the participants were not coerced. Furthermore, the study reported that the participants all accessed the instrument electronically through the Internet. This also implies that they were not exposed to any risks while accessing or responding to the instrument.

The lack of mention or evidence regarding approvals was what prompted the rating of 2 out of 3.
