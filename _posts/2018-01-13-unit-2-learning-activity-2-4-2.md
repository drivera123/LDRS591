Harold Coward is a Canadian scholar with a Bachelor in Divinity and doctoral degree in Philosophy. He was a professor at the University of Victoria and University of Calgary. He is the founding director of the Centre for studies in Religion and Society at the University of Victoria.

<strong>Currency &#8211; Is the source up to date? </strong>

This book was published in 1995, therefore it is not current (within 10 years), however, because the book focuses on responses to consumption and environmental issues, I believe it is still a valuable resource.

<strong>Purpose &#8211; What are the intentions of the author? Who is the intended audience?</strong>

The author seeks to understand how different religions may approach consumerism and environmental issues. He also attempts to view consumerism from a secular point of view, arguing that change is needed within our consumer patterns and habits in order to care for the environment. The author shows that while all religions have some element of &#8220;creation care&#8221; inherent to the religion, this does not seem to make a difference in how people act towards the environment. The intended audience is slightly unclear, though because he looks at a wide range of religions, any conscious consumer of any religious affiliation could benefit from it.

<strong>Publication type/process &#8211; Who published the article? Was the article peer reviewed? </strong>

The book was published by State University of New York Press, in Albany NY in 1995. It was peer reviewed and was nominated for the Grawemeyer Award.

<strong>Are there any obvious biases and/or special interest that the author acknowledges?</strong>

The author approaches the issue from the viewpoint of a number of religions. Therefore, there is little evidence to suggest any bias. His interest is specifically in environmental issues.
