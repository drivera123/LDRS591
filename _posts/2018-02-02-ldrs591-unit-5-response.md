This is a response to <a href="https://create.twu.ca/layla11/2018/02/02/unit-5-learning-activity-5-4/">Layla&#8217;s post</a>.

Hi Layla,

You asked: How do you evaluate the results of a quantitative study when the information of the statistics or instruments is not clear enough? For me, if the statistical information and details of the instruments are not clearly explained, I dismiss the study as valid.

The importance of quality and credibility of a study has been discussed time and time again, and as our learning activities emphasized this week, a lack of indicators that explain the use of an instrument or lack of analysis of the results indicate low quality results and data collection processes. Beyond failing Plano-Clark &amp; Creswell&#8217;s (2015) evaluation process, I would not use an article with more explanations because I  would simply not understand the study in full.

If I cannot understand the results or the instruments they used to produce the results, I do not have faith in the study or my interpretation of the study. Without understanding the process and the resulting statistics, I would find a hard time connecting the results with the purpose of the study. Also, I have a short attention span and would not find it worth my efforts to dig into this study further if the writing of the article poorly explains these important details.

How do you handle the ambiguity of unclear procedures and statistical results?
