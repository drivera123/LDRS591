<strong>Currency</strong>

This book can be considered current because it was published in 2011 and falls within the past ten years. However, it is important to note that technology in education has progressed a lot in the past seven years, with the growth of distributed learning exponentially increasing in the past five years or so.

<strong>Purpose</strong>

The purpose of this book was to explore key questions and issues of digital technologies in mathematics education from a range of expert and professional perspectives (Oldknow &amp; Knights, 2011, p. xix). The intended audience are educators in mathematics education who are interested in incorporating technological teaching methods in their practice. There is a mix of evidence-based and anecdotal research in the chapters written by the different contributors. From a quick skim of the chapters, there is no obvious biases in the contributors&#8217; articles.

<strong>Publication type/process</strong>

This book was published in 2011 by Continuum International Publishing Group. Continuum is a reputable and well-known publishing house based in London and New York. They focus on academic, religious, and trade publishing (Bloomberg, 2018). It is now owned by Bloomberg Publishing House (Bloomberg, 2018).

<strong>Biases/Special Interests</strong>

The biases and special interests are different in every chapter because each chapter is written by a different author. While the language in all the chapters seem pretty objective, there is a clear interest in promoting technology in education and the benefits of a traditional education is not discussed or acknowledged.
