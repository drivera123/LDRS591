For this activity I started a new search- the opioid crisis. We all know this have been in the news lately, so I had no trouble finding journal articles, blogs and newspaper articles. I was able to find only one book. I wasn&#8217;t able to find a dissertation/thesis on it. I probably wasn&#8217;t searching with the right tools. I have asked our Prof to help me with this, and will edit my post with a reference from a dissertation when I find one.
