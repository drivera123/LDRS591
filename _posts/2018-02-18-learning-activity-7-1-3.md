<span style="font-weight: 400">At the heart of the quantitative/qualitative research debate are the strengths and weaknesses of each method of research.  Each method has its limitations. But by designing research to combine the strengths of each of the qualitative and of the quantitative methods, researchers hope to gain a better understanding of the research problem than by just using one type of research on its own (Creswell, J., 2014, P 214). The mixing of the data results is thought to provide a stronger understanding of the research problem. (Creswell, J., 2014, P 214)</span>

</ul>

<span style="font-weight: 400">At a very basic level mixed methods enables the researcher to maximize the strength of both qualitative and quantitative research methods, while minimizing the weakness or limitations of each. (Creswell, J., 2014, P 214)</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The leadership process and the dynamics surrounding it are complex and mixed methods research provides the opportunity for the researcher to gain a better understanding of complex issues. (Stentz et al., 2012, P 1173) By combining methods, the researcher can provide a more complete analysis. (Stentz et al., 2012, P 1174).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Plano-Clark and Creswell (2011) in Stentz et al. (2012),  identity several different types of research designs for mixed methods research. They evolve from the relationship of quantitative and qualitative components and include: “(1) the extent of interaction, (2) the relative priority, (3)  the timing, and (4) where and how they are mixed”. These four criteria determine what framework the research design will take (Stentz et al., 2012, P 1176).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Reflection: What are the best resources or tools that are available to the researcher to help ensure that the questions and the design of a questionnaire in any particular research study, is not biased to give you the results you want?</span>
