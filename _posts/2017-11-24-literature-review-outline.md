<h5>Instructions:</h5>

In this assignment you will write an outline for your literature review paper. An outline can be defined as an organizational plan to help you draft a paper. Writing an outline before beginning a paper is the most effective way to organize your thoughts. An outline begins with identifying your research question and then breaks down the parts of your paper in a clear, hierarchical manner to help you achieve the goal of addressing your research question. Your outline should include the five major sections listed below. Each section provides you with a few questions to help you think through the kind of information you will need to include in each section of your paper.

For this assignment you do not need to use APA style. You may use the template below and write the answers to the questions in bullet points, but please use complete sentences.

<strong>A) Introduction:</strong>

<ul>
    <li>What is the "problem" you are aiming to address?</li>
    <li>What information will you need to provide a broad context for your topic?</li>
    <li>Do you have any relevant statistics that you could use to support "the problem"?</li>
    <li>Why is it important to address this problem?</li>
    <li>What key terms should you define in your introduction so that the reader understands your topic?</li>
    <li>What is the purpose of your paper? Or what research questions are being addressed?</li>
</ul>

<strong>B) Methods:</strong>

<ul>
    <li>How did you choose your articles for your paper?</li>
    <li>What inclusion/exclusion criteria did you use?</li>
    <li>What databases did you search?</li>
    <li>What key search terms did you use?</li>
    <li>How many records were obtained in your search?</li>
    <li>How many articles did you use for your review?</li>
    <li>How will you critically evaluate your articles?</li>
</ul>

<strong>C) Results:</strong>

<ul>
    <li>How will you organize the main body of your paper (e.g., themes or categories, chronologically, theoretical or methodological issues)?</li>
    <li>Did you include 10-15 academic sources?</li>
    <li>How will you summarize the articles you have reviewed?</li>
    <li>Have you included the following information in your summaries: author and year of the study, purpose of the study, type of study conducted, data collection method, and key findings?</li>
    <li>How you will present the "results" from your critical analysis of your 10 to 15 academic sources? Will you present this information in a table or text?</li>
</ul>

Have you critically evaluated each of the articles you have reviewed based on the following questions?

<ul>
    <li>Is there appropriate background information provided?</li>
    <li>Is the research purpose clearly stated?</li>
    <li>Was the study well planned? Was the method appropriate for addressing the research question?</li>
    <li>Were the measures used validated?</li>
    <li>Were the participants adequate and appropriately selected?</li>
    <li>Was the data analysis rigorous and appropriate?</li>
    <li>Were the findings clearly stated?</li>
    <li>Have these studies led to new questions being asked, new ways of using existing knowledge?</li>
    <li>Are possible explanations for any inconsistencies in the literature uncovered?</li>
</ul>

<strong>D) Discussion:</strong>

<ul>
    <li>What is the problem you are addressing?</li>
    <li>What are the major results you found?</li>
    <li>How would you interpret your results (e.g., what are the gaps, inconsistencies, strengths and weaknesses based on your critical evaluation)?</li>
    <li>Do your results connect with previous research?</li>
    <li>What are the key limitation(s) of your results?</li>
    <li>Can you offer a rationale for why future research should be conducted on this topic?</li>
    <li>Why are your findings important?</li>
    <li>What are the practical implications of your findings?</li>
</ul>

<strong>E) Personal Reflection (not usually included in a scholarly article, but required for this class only):</strong>

<ul>
    <li>Why is this topic personally meaningful to you?</li>
    <li>How will you use the information in this review to improve your personal or professional practices?</li>
</ul>
