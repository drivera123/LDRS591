<strong>A Summary of the Article titled: </strong><strong>Entrepreneurship Development: </strong>

<strong>An approach to Economic Empowerment of Women</strong>

<strong> </strong>

<strong>Introduction</strong>

The article identified several problems that affect the socio-economic fortunes of women in general, and women entrepreneurs in India. It described the involvement of selected Indian government institutions in women entrepreneurship, and what could be done to use entrepreneurship development as a tool for empowering women economically. There was no research hypothesis in the article.

<strong>Methods</strong>

The author made use of secondary data obtained from published reports of journals, websites and publications from credible government institutions in India. A qualitative study design was used in the research. There were no experimental manipulations mentioned by the author, also, the author did not make reference to any specific research problem.

<strong>Results/Findings</strong>

The author described how trends in India indicate an increase in the number of women entrepreneurs.  This, notwithstanding, the author also mentioned several problems which, if not addressed, could potentially reduce the growing number of women entrepreneurs. Some of these problems include: the lack of entrepreneurial skillsets, discrimination, and other socio-cultural factors which create obstacles for prospective women entrepreneurs.

Several measures that could help reduce the problems were described by the author. Such measures include; securing the involvement and support of government agencies and International organizations like the World Bank. These institutions could provide support with the design of programmes that could bring about positive attitudinal changes towards women and women entrepreneurs. Such programmes should be aimed at helping more women realise their unique identity and the importance of their role in the economic growth of their country.

Other measures described were; re-designing the school curriculum to ensure that women are deliberately taught or exposed to entrepreneurship from childhood, exposing more women to structured trainings that will develop their entrepreneurial skills and also to information technology as a tool for automation. The author also described the importance of engaging already established women entrepreneurs and women development corporations in the training of more women along the path of entrepreneurship.

In my opinion, the results/findings of the author were quite relevant but not extraordinary.

<strong>Conclusions</strong>

Conclusions were based on the following quote from Jawaharlal Nehru, “you can tell the condition of a nation by looking at the status of its women.” Based on this, the author emphasized the need for an attitudinal change towards women in general and also women entrepreneurs; an attitudinal change would aid the development of an enabling environment for women to unleash their entrepreneurial talents. In the authors’ thoughts, an increase in women entrepreneurs would have positive implications for the future economic prosperity of their society.

<strong>Personal Comments</strong>

I found the article informative, it provided guidance on how more women could be empowered by encouraging them to embrace entrepreneurship as a means for enhancing their socio-economic fortunes. Although the author was biased towards women in India, the discussion and suggestions are also relevant to women in most of the developing countries.

The study relates to my research topic because it provides general information entrepreneurship as a method for empowering women. The article has helped in guiding my thought process towards contemplating the possible limitations or challenges of entrepreneurship as a tool for empowering women. With this, I may also consider possible alternatives to entrepreneurship, which is of relevance to my research topic.
