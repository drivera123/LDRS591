<pre><code>I chose the article listed below because it was the topic that most interested me. It did not let me down! I thoroughly enjoyed the reading, particularly how the author compared and contrasted Servant Leadership according to Greenleaf and Jesus. Overall, in my opinion, this article rates as a three because of all the criteria for “Evaluating the Statement of the Problem in a Research Report”(Plano Clark &amp;amp; Crewell, 2015, p.93). The following discussion below explains my reasoning as to why I believe so.

Sendjaya and Sarros explain in their introduction their article doesn’t seek to solve a problem but instead seeks to help future researchers solve problems, “The current developmental stage of the servant leadership movement is explored in order to provide some useful signposts for future research directions. This, to me, is justified reasoning in the importance of their writing. In congruence with this, they clearly identify a preferred audience as future researchers and clearly explain that they want their article to be used as a springboard into further research on the subject. Their article is clearly well warranted.

The passage is well written with recent and numerous sources. It’s as if the authors tried to combine as much research as they could to truly make their work the first step for future researchers. On top of this, they provide researchers with possible topics including the following: Can servant leadership be measured and/or what are some organizational factors that are likely to foster and inhibit servant leadership? (Sendjaya &amp;amp; Sarros, 2002, p.63). Overall, I found the article insightful, useful, scholarly, and professional.
