<strong><em>As a consumer of research reports, the most important thing(s) for me in the introduction section of a high-quality research report is/are . . .</em></strong>

Based on my research questions, the topic has the relevant answer to my inquiry which I can find in the abstract and the introduction, I need to decide if I want to have explanations or exploration to answer my research questions. What i need to process my research questions. Plano- Clark, and Cresswell(2015) explained the reasons behind reading research to add knowledge, inform your position on policies and help improve the practice to expand upon your inquiry research question. Therefore, Is the issue needs to be studied found?, then justifying the importance of the problem concerning the deficiencies in the knowledge about the problem required (Plano- Clark, and Cresswell, 2015, p.91). Once the researchers specify the purpose of their study, they can conduct their research through a process of research and research design ( Plano- Clark, and Cresswell, 2015, p. 14).

Finding the framework for my research interest, selecting participants and the proper siting to examine the inquiry research questions, then use the proper method of analysis to conduct the research based on the previous literature review. The audience that may benefit from research, in my opinion, any practitioners or other individuals use the missing knowledge if it became known. Plano- Clark, and Cresswell, 2015, p91).

Organizing the literature into themes, Literature map will have a better understanding of the framework that was designed.

Method of conduct, data analysis, and results with rational analysis to the critical results add value to the quality of chosen literature in comparison to what was done related to the topic of interest.

Finally, What more Researchers, practitioners, or audience can contribute?
