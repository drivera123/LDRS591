The following is my review of the data analysis and results in the article titled: <em>Leader purposefulness within servant leadership, leader follower-focus, leader goal-orientation, and leader purposefulness in a large U.S. healthcare organization</em>, by (Justin A.Irving &amp; Julie Berndt, 2017).

I performed the review by applying criteria provided in the book titled: <em>Understanding research, a consumer’s guide</em>, by (Plano-Clark, V., &amp; Creswell, 2015, p. 278).

<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Were descriptive analyses reported? </strong></h5>

<strong>Rating – 3/3</strong>

Although the researches did not explicitly discuss descriptive statistics in the data analysis section of the study, they calculated the mean and standard deviation for all the major variables used in the study. This information was provided in section 6.2 of the study. In addition, I found that the descriptive statistic was appropriate for the variables used in the study.

<strong> </strong>

<h5><strong>What inferential statistics were used?</strong></h5>

<strong>Rating – 3/3</strong>

I was able to identify the use of the following inferential statistics in the study;

<ol>
<li>Multiple analysis of variance (MANOVA)</li>
<li>Multiple regression standardized coefficient</li>
<li>R squared</li>
<li>Pearson correlation</li>
<li>Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin Measure of Sampling Adequacy</li>
<li>Bartlett’s Test of Sphericity</li>
</ol>

From the above, it is evident that the study made use of inferential statistics for comparing groups of variables, and also for exploring the relationships among the major variables. This, I believe, was absolutely needed for the study.

<strong> </strong>

<h5><strong>What results were found?</strong></h5>

<strong>Rating – 3/3</strong>

The results in the study covered three broad categories; the instruments used, the hypothesized relationships, and the relationships among the hypothesized variables i.e. regression analyses. Information about the participants was provided in the <em>study participants </em>section of the study.

Regarding the instruments used, the study noted an unintentional input error that resulted in recording of 22 of the response items (from the participants) instead of 24. Regardless, the reported reliability coefficients of the instruments were well above the minimum of 0.7.

The hypothesis relationships each had moderate to strong correlation; the lowest being 0.4, and the highest, 0.88. Also, according to the study, all correlations were statistically significant at the &lt;0.001 level.

Finally, according to the study, multiple regression and hierarchical regression analyses were used to further test the hypothesis; the results were reported with <strong>p</strong> values between &lt;0.001 and &lt;0.05.

I would like to conclude that the study reported each result with the required statistic, value and corresponding p value. Also, the information in tables, figures and text were clear and consistent with the overall research design. The authors also provided discussions that were based on the results obtained.

<h5></h5>

<h5><strong>Did the analysis represent a good quantitative process?</strong></h5>

<strong>Rating – 3/3</strong>

Absolutely yes! It was evident from the reporting of the results, among others, that the data analysis followed a deductive, objective, and linear process that was based on the gathered data.
