<td width="198">a)     The topic is introduced by a famous essay and how it has affected the real world. (the first two sentences)</p>

b)    The topic is depicted in a broad way.

c)     I found the subject matter appealing because the authors provide two possible explanations for the main topic which pique my interest of keeping reading it.</td>

<td width="205">2.There is a meaningful problem.</td>
<td width="21">&nbsp;</td>
<td width="21">&nbsp;</td>
<td width="21">&nbsp;</td>
<td width="21">3</td>
<td width="198">a)     The authors claim that the existing understanding of servant leadership is not enough.

b)    Two problems are clearly addressed and stated explicitly.

c)     The first problem is about “the need to better understand the scope and magnitude of the influence that servant leadership has on a range of multilevel outcomes and…”

d)    The second problem is the need of more advanced research designs and more comprehensive explorations to help managers better apply servant leadership in the real world.</td>

<td width="21">&nbsp;</td>
<td width="21">&nbsp;</td>
<td width="21">3</td>
<td width="198">Clear evidence of the importance of the problem is provided by plenty of references in the literature.

For example: Hofmann, 2002; Yammarino &amp; Bass, 1991; Liden et al., 2008; Walumbwa et al., 2010a; and so on.</td>

<td width="21">&nbsp;</td>
<td width="21">&nbsp;</td>
<td width="21">&nbsp;</td>
<td width="21">3</td>
<td width="198">The authors have identified several deficiencies about the problem:

a)     The results of Walumbwa et al. (2010a) were not clear, therefore, the results need to be extended;

b)    The individual-level outcomes have received little attention by servant leadership scholars, therefore, need to be noticed;

c)     The traits linked to servant leadership and its outcome remain unclear.

d)    There is only one study has linked leader agreeableness to servant leader behaviors; no studies have investigated leader extraversion.</td>
