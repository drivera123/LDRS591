The most important things for me about the conclusions section of a high-quality research report are having the results clearly identified and summarized as well as having the limitations explicitly stated.

For me, it is important for the results to be clearly summarized and stated because oftentimes the methods section is not easily understandable, especially if the procedures include in-depth analysis using specific and complicated statistical calculations. The results section should clearly state the correlations that were found and explain and analyze the results that were collected from the study. Relationships between different factors should be explained and trends should be drawn and stated.

It is important for limitations to be clearly stated because it allows the reader to use it to measure the level of consistency and validity in the results that are presented. As well, limitation can help give direction for further research and how to improve on the current study and research.

Implications for practice is also an important part of the conclusions section. This section is what makes the research relevant and practical. It allows the reader to understand the importance of the research and acts as the important &#8220;take away&#8221; for the study.

My question is: <strong>Stating the limitations of a study can help readers determine the validity of the study and to understand some of the biases in the study. However, since the weaknesses are being pointed out, does stating the limitation strengthen or weaken the results of the study? </strong>
