<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Is the study’s purpose clearly specified?</span></li>
</ul>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Yes the purpose of the study is clearly stated. It is to “identify empirical studies that explored servant leadership theory by engaging a sample population in order to assess and synthesize the mechanisms and outcomes and impact on servant leadership” (Parris, D., &amp; Peachey, J., 2013, p. 377).</span>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Is the focus of the study appropriate?</span></li>
</ul>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The focus of the study is appropriate, but it is very broad as it is a Systematic Literature Review. The variables are clearly defined in the summary, but are vague:  “the researchers sought to provide an evidence-based answer of how does servant leadership work and how can we apply it” (Parris, D., &amp; Peachey, J., 2013, p. 377).</span>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Is the overall intent of the study appropriate?</span></li>
</ul>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Yes, the intent is clearly stated. The researchers are clear on what they hope to learn. “Thus, we sought to provide an evidence-informed answer to how does servant leadership work, and how can we apply it?”(Parris, D., &amp; Peachey, J., 2013, p. 377).</span>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Are the participants and the sites appropriate?</span></li>
</ul>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Yes the participants and the sites are appropriate. “A disciplined screening process resulted in a final sample population of 39 appropriate studies” (Parris, D., &amp; Peachey, J., 2013, p. 377).</span>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Is the purpose of the study narrowed through appropriate research questions and/or hypotheses?</span></li>
</ul>

<span style="font-weight: 400">In terms of what literature was selected, the study was definitely narrowed by virtue of the fact that it was a systematic review of literature rather than a narrative review.  “The purpose of this study was to systematically examine and organize the current body of research literature that either quantitatively or qualitatively explored servant leadership theory in a given organizational setting. In this SRL we only included empirical studies that investigated servant leadership in an organizational context and excluded studies with a primary focus on model development or testing measurement instruments.(Parris, D., &amp; Peachey, J., 2013, p. 378).</span>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Does the purpose of the study follow logically from the statement of the problem and the literature review?</span></li>
</ul>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Yes the purpose of the study is to assess empirical studies that explored theories of servant leadership in organizations to determine the impact of servant leadership on organizations (Parris, D., &amp; Peachey, J., 2013, p. 377). </span>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Is the purpose consistent with the study’s overall approach?</span></li>
</ul>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Yes the purpose is consistent with the study’s overall approach. I would rate the research study as 3.</span>
