<strong>In response to Tom Williams&#8217; post- LA 7.1, Thank you for the useful information provided</strong>

<strong>Creswell (2013) outlines that mixed method approach is used widely in mainstream media already. My question is, do you think people have a natural personal preference towards connecting with data or stories more? If so, where does this come from?</strong>

Emotions are incredibly important for all human interactions, and they are integral to connecting with others. Although you can, of course, get an emotion across in words, but sometimes reading other people’s faces for emotional cues make a difference.

I believe, its both to a certain extent, and depends on what you are approaching or trying to solve a problem if it persists. Sometimes you may prefer to go with data that support your search and give generalization for the situation you have if needed to be generalized. On the other side, you may need to have shared stories from experts to present a different form of data that have &#8220;voice,&#8221; &#8221; expression or facial cues.&#8221; Hence, any feelings you trying to decode, and they are needed to reveal on a particular point, they are necessary to investigate.
