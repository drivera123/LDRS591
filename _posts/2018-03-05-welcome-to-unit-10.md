Congratulations! You have made it to the final week of LDRS 591: Scholarly Inquiry!  Here is what you have coming up this week:

<ol>
<li><strong>Learning Activities:</strong> For the learning activities this week you will be revisiting a question about making informed decisions, discussing why evidence-based decision making is important for the Transformational Servant Leader, and writing a reflection on what your expectations are now for a high quality research report.</li>
<li><strong>Assignment 5:</strong> The last assignment for this class is the Formal Literature Review (assignment 5). The course timeline is telling you to submit your final assignment for peer-review by March 9th.  Please do not worry if you are not finished writing your final paper by the 9th (next Sunday).  The final paper is not due until March 23rd.  However, out of courtesy, please contact your peer-review partner and work out a timeline that is appropriate for both of you to submit your paper to each other for peer-review, spend time reviewing it, and make any suggested changes before submitting it for grading.  Also, if you need more time to work on your final paper after the peer-review process, please contact me.</li>
<li><strong>The Leadership Integration Project (LDRS 697/698):  </strong>This week I will be posting a video/slide presentation for you on the Leadership Integration Project (LIP) which is your final capstone project in the MA Lead program.  I am the LIP coordinator for the Langley and Online cohorts and at the end of my face to face class in LDRS 591 I spend half of the day providing learners with an orientation to the LIP.  I will do this for you in video/slide presentation format and then you can ask me question via email.  Stay tuned for this information posted on my blog by the end of this week.</li>
<li> <strong>Grades:</strong> All of your grades for your assignments and blog posts have been posted on our course site on Moodle.  If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact me.</li>
</ol>

I think that wraps it up for this week.  I will provide one final post next Monday to close our time together.

I hope you all have a great week.

Dr. Strong
