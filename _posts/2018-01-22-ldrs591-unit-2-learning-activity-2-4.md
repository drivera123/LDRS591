&nbsp;

The following, is my appraisal of the book;

&nbsp;

<h5><strong>Authority</strong></h5>

At the time of publication, the lead author and his colleagues were active members of the Panel Study Income Dynamics (PSID), instituted by the Survey Research Center at The University of Michigan’s Institute for Social Research.  An Internet search revealed that the book had 341 citations within the first ten years of its publication. It also had a further 472 citations in subsequent years. In total 813 citations including once citation in year 2018! This, speaks volumes about the authority of the authors on the subject matter.

&nbsp;

<h5><strong>Currency</strong></h5>

The article was published in 1984. Sadly, it is already outdated as per current standards.

&nbsp;

<h5><strong>Purpose</strong></h5>

The book presented clear insights gathered from fifteen years of extensively researched data in a concise but also very detailed manner to provide a guidance to policy-makers desirous of social justice. Although the authors targeted a broad American audience of individuals in general, the book was also written to help anyone interested in consumer economics. This includes social and economic policy-makers and analysts. The tone of the book, the results discussed and research methods did not suggest any bias from the authors.

&nbsp;

<h5><strong>Content, publication type / process</strong></h5>

As per content, the book presented a distilled and highly readable version of fifteen years of research data gathered by tracking the pattern of economic progress and economic changes in 5,000 American households over time, since 1968. The research methods were endorsed by the reviewers from the Journal of Consumer Affairs. In addition to being peer-reviewed, the book was published by the Institute for Social Research, University of Michigan. This suggests a comprehensive research study.

&nbsp;

<h5><strong>Bias and special interests</strong></h5>

The interpretation of research results and study design reflected no bias on the part of the reviewers. All findings were backed by traceable data and also results from other research sources, where applicable. However, the reviewers mentioned that the book would appeal to people sympathetic to democratic capitalism. This may give a possible inclination of the interests of the reviewers, authors, or both.
