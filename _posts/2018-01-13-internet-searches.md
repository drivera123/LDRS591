Internet search activity- https://create.twu.ca/ldrs591-sp18/unit-2-learning-activities/

So far my use of research has been based on articles that I read in a few peer-reviewed journals that I subscribe to. These have been articles that I read to update myself on the current advances in my field.  While one would think that an internet search for scholarly articles would be &#8216;easy&#8217; , and intuitive, clearly that is not the case! I learnt some strategies from watching the videos and reading the text, that would help me in the future in my scholarly inquiries. I plan to start using &#8216;Google scholar&#8217; and try out &#8216;Microsoft Academic&#8217;., as well as Google advance search.

Out of all the strategies I learnt about in these resources, I think the one I would be using is &#8216;combining search histories&#8217;, as explained in the video, &#8216;managing search histories..&#8217; .This was an entirely new concept to me, and I think knowing this could make researching articles easier.

One very useful strategy I learnt was how to manage your references , by using a reference manager, like Endnote or Refworks.

From the video &#8216;formatting book references for bibliography&#8217;, I learnt the use of &#8216;Worldcat&#8217;  that I think could be very a useful strategy to help me with formatting my citations.

I found that the short videos were were very helpful in introducing these strategies, much more than the textbook. It might have mostly been due to the fact that visual of the process is much easier to get across than explain it in text. I also realized that I need to explore the library website to practice what I learnt in these videos.
