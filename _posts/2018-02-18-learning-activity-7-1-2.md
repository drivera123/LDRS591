<strong>What is at the heart of the quantitative/qualitative debate?</strong>

The advantage of qualitative research designs are that they are &#8220;logical sets of procedures for collecting, analyzing, and reporting numeric data to answer research questions and test hypotheses about specific variables&#8221; (Plano Clark  &amp; Creswell, 2015, p. 192), making them mostly impartial, unbiased, and replicable. In contrast, &#8220;qualitative research designs are sets of procedures for collecting, analyzing, and reporting text and image data to answer research questions by exploring participants&#8217; views (Plano Clark &amp; Creswell, 2015, p. 286), allowing for more in-depth exploration of aspects that cannot be quantified, such as emotions and perspective. As a student with a science and mathematics background, I am more familiar with quantitative research studies where hypotheses are stated and tested through controlled environments and empirical data is collected, analyzed, and explained through trends and statistical applications. There is usually little room for author bias. Qualitative research studies allow researchers to explore experiences that cannot be measured empirically and analyze the effect that these experiences have on certain individuals. While quantitative research gives solid, proven results, qualitative research allows the study of more complex human experiences.

<strong>How has mixed methods been seen as a remedy for advancing leadership research?</strong>

Researchers now understand that &#8220;multitude of research methods arevneeded to understand the complexity of leader performance and how leaders affect many aspects of our world&#8221; (Stenz, Plano Clark, &amp; Matkin, 2012, p. 1174). Quantitative studies can measure the empirical effect that leadership has on performance, but qualitative studies explore why these effects happen. In order to fully understand the measurable effects of leadership, one must understand the interactions between leadership and staff that lead to these results.
