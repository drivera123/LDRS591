ADHD is a diagnosed at a very high rate. This study investigates the relationship between exposure to PCDD/Fs and PCBs and lead on attention performance in children. It is the first study to the author’s knowledge of prenatal exposure to PCDD/Fs and PCBs and consequently how it impacts the exposed children with respect to attention performance in school. Exposure to to these neurotoxicants are thought to be contributing elements to the diagnoses of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

<strong>Methods</strong>

<strong>Sample and Participant Selection</strong>

Within the Duisburg Birth Cohort Study, a study measured blood levels of PCDD/Fs, PCBs and lead in expecting mothers during their 32nd week of pregnancy.  Levels of PCDD/Fs, PCBs and lead in the breast milk of mothers 2 weeks postpartum were measured. 117 school-age children with an average age of 8.5 participated in the KITAP testing.  114 school-age children with an average age of 9.5 completed the computer FBB-ADHS testing.  Participant selection included pre-screening the children using the Wechsler Intelligence scale.  One child who exhibited an intelligence quotient of less than 80 was elminated.

&nbsp;

<strong>Assessments and Measures</strong>

School-aged children were tested for attention span using a questionnaire that was filled out by parents and through a computer-based test battery of attention performance (KITAP). Researchers used a multiple regression analysis to determine if exposure to these compounds influenced attention spans.

<strong>Results</strong>

The results showed that an increased exposure to PCDD/F and PCB did not significantly impact the ADHD-related behaviours. Researchers found that ADHD-related behaviours were affected by prenatal lead exposure. Increasing lead exposure, resulted in increased ADHD related behaviours.

<strong>Discussion</strong>

The study highlights the influence of prenatal PCDD/F, PCB and lead exposure on behaviours that are associated with ADHD.

<strong>Limitations of the Present Study</strong>

The sample size was somewhat small.  It is recommended that a longer post natal study be conducted to determine the effect of exposure to neurotoxicants over a longer period of time.

<strong>Conclusions and Future Prospects</strong>

Pre- and perinatal exposure to PCDD/F and PCB can influence or increase the ADHD behaviours in young and otherwise healthy children. Research indicates that environmental contaminants can be a factor in affecting the development of healthy children. Beyond dietary choice or knowledgeable exposure, women and children can be unknowingly exposed to harmful neurotoxicants. While it is clear that diet, (nutritional factors, the amount of processed food consumed, or chemical additives ingested) plays an important role, it is clear that factors other than diet and nutrition can play a role in the healthy development of children. It is probable that there are many other causal factors involved in the development of attention related disorders. The causes of attention related disorders are complex and possibly interrelated, and it is clear that the potential influence of external factors such as environmental organic pollutants cannot be ignored.
