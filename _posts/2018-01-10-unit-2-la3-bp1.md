<strong>Authority – Who is the author? What are the author’s credentials?</strong><br />
The author is Daniel (Dan) Gould Ph.D. He is a professor of kinesiology and director of the Institute for the study of youth sports at Michigan State University (MSU). His MSU (2018) online profile states:

&#8220;His area of expertise is mental training for athletic competition and sports psychology. His research interests include the stress-athletic performance relationship, psychological foundations of coaching, athlete motivation, youth leadership and positive youth development through sport. He has been a consultant for the U.S. Olympic Committee, the United States Tennis Association and numerous athletes of all ages and skill levels.&#8221;

<strong>Currency – Is the source up to date?</strong><br />
The article was published in May 2016 and is covering current argument and debate about the topic.

<strong>Purpose – What are the intentions of the author? Who is the intended audience?</strong><br />
The article is aimed at K-12 educators who are interested in coaching school sport. It is making the argument for why coaching is important and demonstrating the differences between good and bad examples of coaching. I believe based on the author&#8217;s credentials above and interests that this article is of good intention and has been written to further information in the coaching psychology field.

<strong>Publication type/process – Who published the article? Was the article peer reviewed?</strong><br />
The article was published by kappan magazine which is funded by phi delta kappa international. Although submitted articles to the magazine are reviewed by magazine editors, it is stipulated that there isn&#8217;t a peer review process.

<strong>Are there any obvious biases and/or special interests that the author acknowledges?</strong><br />
It doesn&#8217;t appear there are any ulterior motives or specific bias in the article. However, I did notice that there is a list of coaching education providers highlighted. The article does stress the importance of coach education, so there is potentially a slight bias or influence identified.
