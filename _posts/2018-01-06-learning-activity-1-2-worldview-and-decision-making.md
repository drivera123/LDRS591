<h3>Worldview and Decision Making</h3>

I completely support the proposition made in the course notes that one&#8217;s worldview influences the types of questions one asks and the processes one uses to find answers. After studying postmodernism, in philosophy, I am very much of the mindset that we each experience reality from a individual perspective. The struggle of social interaction is that we try to understand one another&#8217;s bias/perspective, but ultimately we can only see the world from our own perspective. We can only understand one another in relation to ourselves. While it is impossible for me to completely understand another persons worldview, I can struggle to understand it. That being said, one of the most profound concepts of the nature of God is his omniscience. He is completely able to understand all people and their reasons and thoughts.  Our understanding of the world, of reality, truth, and justice, is skewed by our sin nature and our personal bias. Due to this distorting lens of sin and selfishness we all seek answers that appeal to our own worldview, we all ask questions that fit within our perspective. We struggle to find truth without looking at it from a biased perspective.

<h3>What factors do you think shape your decision-making process as a leader?</h3>

Many factors influence my decision-making process as a leader. My worldview is the first factor, followed by the worldview of those I lead. Physical and tangible factors such as space, money, etc can affect my decision making. Experiential factors alter my worldview and reshape it as I grow and change, thus experience plays a large role in my decision making process. Ethical factors and issues of morality from a personal and corporate standpoint often shape policy and thus create a foundation for decision making. There are a myriad of things that influence decision making, but ultimately it comes down to the leader navigating through all these factors and choosing the one that will best benefit the organization and the people.

<h3>Discussion Question:</h3>

Prior to beginning this masters program we had to complete the myers briggs personality test. How do you feel your results reflect your worldview. Do your personality results match up with who you think you are? How does your personality type influence the types of questions you ask?
