<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">My concept map has inspired me to learn more about:</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">1. How does overall health impact students with special needs?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">2. How does staff morale impact health and well-being?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">3. Does a person’s level of interest or passion for their job impact staff morality, unity and willingness to collaborate?</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Identify the research question you feel is </span><b>the strongest one</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> to pursue for a future research paper, and outline reasons for your selection.</span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">The research question that I feel is the strongest, as well as the msot interesting to me is:  How does overall health impact students with special needs? I have only been in my teaching career for less than 5 years however, I have noticed trends in students with certain special needs. I have often wondered or been intrigued by the effect that certain foods may have one people. In particular, I have taught 2 severely violent students. In both of these cases, I have noticed that neither of the two students were eating proper nutrition. I truly believe that the chemicals or the dyes that are in processed and packaged foods may play a role for these students. I would be very interested to research this and find out more about it. </span></li>
</ul>

<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">In what broad fields do you anticipate searching for literature that might inform your research question (e.g., education, business, psychology, healthcare, leadership, religion)?</span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">If I were to research this topic, I believe I would find most of my information in education research, psychology as well as healthcare. </span></li>
