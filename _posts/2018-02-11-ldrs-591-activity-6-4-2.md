As a consumer of research reports the most important thing for me in a high quality qualitative research report are participants and data collection.

Participants. Since sample sizes in qualitative studies are typically smaller, and data collection is more intensive, participant selection is very vital to the validity of the process. The researchers must explain their reasons for chosing to study the participants and have a justification for their sample size and sampling strategy. Since participant responses in qualitative studies are subjective, I like to see that participant selection was unbiased, and preferably without employer involvement. I understand it might not always be possible for an employer to be totally &#8220;blind&#8221; to their employees&#8217; participation, I think employee responses could be inaccurate if they were wary of employer response. I would like to see an explanation from the researchers how this was addressed.

Data collection. <span style="float: none;background-color: transparent;color: #333333;cursor: text;font-family: 'Lato',Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-style: normal;font-variant: normal;font-weight: 400;letter-spacing: normal;text-align: left;text-decoration: none;text-indent: 0px">As I understand the qualitative research process better , I learn that qualitative studies can evolve along the way. The researchers keep an open mind and so must the reader. It is the researchers&#8217; responsibility to explain their rationale for making the changes they did. Explanation by the researchers that detailed audio notes , and transcriptions were taken and referred to, along with field notes, elicits trust in their process. The researchers might have to create new data collection tools during the course of the study as it progresses. I would like to see the rationale behind the creation of these new tools, and attempts made by researchers to ensure the reader of the accuracy and importance of the new tools. </span>

As an end note, I will say that I agree with Layla when she says that understanding the research design adopted in the study is important for the reader to best understand the study. Ideally, I would like it if the researchers would name the research design in their methods section.

Question: Since the qualitative process is &#8216;explorative&#8217; and &#8216;evolves&#8217; along the way, the results could be interpreted in different ways. Since the reader doesn&#8217;t always have access to the analysis tools or programs used by the researchers, how does the reader reconcile their interpretation with that of the researchers? Seems like trust in the researchers is an important element to the consumer of qualitative research.
