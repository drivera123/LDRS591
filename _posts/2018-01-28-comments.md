I find that articles with misleading titles often put me off of getting past the abstract/intro. When searching through a database for a bunch of articles on a specific topic, it is frustrating to see key words used in a title that may not be related to the research of the article. I found this frustrating when searching for articles about computational thinking and coding. There are many definitions of coding, but some articles were not even related to the subject in even an vague way.

One deal breaker for me would be seeing hypotheses labelled as fact. When an author&#8217;s bias is pronounced and rigid, and they do not seem open to all possible outcomes of the study, I feel their research is overly biased and not always worth the effort of sifting through.
