The following is my evaluation of the participants and data collection in the study by Russell, Maxfield, &amp; Russell, (2017). I performed the evaluation by applying criteria provided by Plano-Clark &amp; Creswell (2015, p. 349).

&nbsp;

<h5><strong>The sampling strategy was appropriate and justified </strong></h5>

<strong>Rating – 3/3</strong>

The study sites comprised multiple for-profit organizations with headquarters in Western U.S. The participants from these sites were all senior level leaders in the age-range of 43-64; with 12 being male and 2 being female, according to the study. Also, the sampling procedure was based on the use of pre-selected specific experts.

The researchers made use of a purposeful sampling strategy known as expert sampling because, “it allows for theoretical discovery involving data collection and analysis from pre-selected specific experts.” (Russell, Maxfield, &amp; Russel, 2017, p. 85).

&nbsp;

<h5><strong>Was the sample size appropriate and justified? </strong></h5>

<strong>Rating – 2/3</strong>

A small sample size of 14 participants contributed the data used in the study (p. 84). The sample size was justified because the individual participants were recruited on an ongoing basis and information was gathered until the researchers reached a point of saturation. I believe the researchers were able to capture rich details from the sample. However, the sample size was not appropriate because Plano-Clark &amp; Creswell (2015, p. 336) suggest that a sample size of 20 to 30 individuals should be used in a grounded theory study.

&nbsp;

<h5><strong>The data types were appropriate</strong></h5>

<strong>Rating – 3/3</strong>

The data type used in the study was an open-ended questionnaire which is a type of interview (Russell et al., 2017, p. 84). I believe this data type was appropriate for the study because the information gathered from the participants could not be obtained easily using observation or other data types.

<strong> </strong>

<h5><strong> </strong><strong>Was the data gathered using rigorous qualitative procedures?</strong></h5>

<strong>Rating – 2/3</strong>

The researchers gathered data using open-ended questionnaires in order to encourage the participants to provide detailed personal information. The questionnaires were also free from researchers’ bias. (p. 84).

In my opinion, the use of an online database for data storage and access to questions by the participants guaranteed an accurate recording of all questions and responses. However, this also suggests that the researchers neither spent a lot of time at the sites, nor used any of the emergent procedures suggested by Plano-Clark &amp; Creswell (2015, p. 349).

&nbsp;

<h5><strong>Data collection issues were handled ethically and thoughtfully</strong></h5>

<strong>Rating – 3/3</strong>

Absolutely! It was evident that the researchers secured approvals for the research from their University. The study showed that the participants were respectfully treated as they responded privately and accessed the questionnaires anonymously. Lastly, the anonymity of the participants was protected. (pp. 84-85).

&nbsp;

<h5><strong>The selected participants are information rich</strong></h5>

<strong>Rating – 3/3</strong>

Absolutely! The distribution of sites and the status of the participants indicate that the participants are capable of providing rich information relevant for the study purpose. (p. 84).

&nbsp;

<h5><strong>The database provided extensive and credible information about the central phenomenon</strong></h5>

<strong>Rating – 3/3</strong>

Absolutely! The researchers affirmed that they followed a well-structured approach for data analyses. They also established a secure database for data collection and storage. (p. 85).
