This is a response to Mr. Williams post found here: https://mrwilliamsphysed.wordpress.com/2018/01/28/unit-4-la5-bp1/

Your discussion question &#8211; How often do you read a full introduction when searching for literature? &#8211; made me laugh, Mr. Williams! I must admit, I probably read 10% of the introductions in full during my search for literature.

While I too dismiss articles based on their title, I do not find myself attracted to specific reference names in the title as you shared. What attracts me and keeps me reading in a title are key words relating to my writing, and I am specifically attracted to articles that explain the general idea of the study within a few words of the title. For me, a title&#8217;s ability to convey the general idea of the study not only helps me identify relevancy for my writing but also shows me the strength of its concise language.

Secondly, I identify with your act of stopping at the abstract. Correct me if I am wrong, but I was led to believe this is what abstracts are for. Abstracts summarize the main purpose, study, and outcomes, and I believe this is enough to get a sense of whether the article is appropriate for your purposes. I have long appreciated well-written abstracts that provide me a clear idea of the article&#8217;s purpose and findings; it saves people countless hours of their lives. Conversely, if the abstract is written with nonsensical jargon I do not understand or poorly conveys the purpose of the study, I will stop reading.

Thanks for the great question!
