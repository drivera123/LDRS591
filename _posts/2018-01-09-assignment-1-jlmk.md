My map consists of four major sections of interest. These are located in the orange circles; art, music, history, and education. The blue triangles represent three sub-areas within each of these subjects. The subject of art was divided into impressionism, Monet, and painting. The subject of music was divided into Taylor Swift, piano, and country music. The subject of history was divided into World War Two, the Victorian era, and Tudor history. Finally, the subject of education is divided into kindergarten to grade seven, art, and history.

On this map, I have identified three potential research questions that connect in some of these areas. Between Tudor history and impressionism I thought it would be interesting to see if there were elements of impressionism in Tudor art given that impressionism was not prevalent until the late nineteenth century. Another connection I made was between World War Two history and education for kindergarten through grade seven. I thought it would be intriguing to find out how a teacher should go about teaching such mature content to young minds, especially given the importance of the subject to Canadian history. The last research idea I came up with was between history and my musical idol Taylor Swift. I thought it would be fascinating to look at Taylor Swift’s historical impact in regards to feminism. She is known as one of the most powerful and influential women in the world and has done much work in the area of woman empowerment.

If I had to choose one of the above-described research questions to pursue I would probably pick the one revolving World War Two history and education from kindergarten to grade seven. This option appeals to me above the rest because on my practicum my inquiry question revolved how to have difficult conversations with students. In addition to already being a subject that I have shown great interest in, the students of every school around the country partake in Remembrance Day assemblies. So being able to teach such a complex subject to younger audiences is definitely appealing to me because of annual occurrences that revolve it.

If I were to research a question like this I would probably look for literature in the field of education, history, and possibly development. In addition to reading literature and findings, I would also ask for the advice of colleagues to see how they have taught similar subjects.
