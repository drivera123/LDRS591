For this activity, I chose to focus on Carter and Baghurst’s (2014) article <em>The Influence of Servant Leadership on Restaurant Employee Engagement</em>.

<ol>
<li><em>What sampling strategy is used and is it appropriate and justified?</em><br />
<strong>Rating: 3/3<br />
</strong>Purposeful sampling was used for this study (Carter &amp; Baghurst, 2014). The researchers specifically choose employees from a restaurant where servant leadership was recognized (Carter &amp; Baghurst, 2014, p. 455). More specifically, homogeneous sampling was used when the researchers chose participants based on a specific criteria (eg. needed to have a minimum of 5 years experience with the restaurant) (Carter &amp; Baghurst, 2014, p. 455).</li>
<li><em>Is the sample size appropriate?</em><br />
<strong>Rating: 2/3<br />
</strong>The sample size for this quite small with only 11 participants (Carter &amp; Baghurst, 2014, p. 455). However, given that the participants needed to fulfill specific criteria (minimum of 5 years experience working in a restaurant recognized for it&#8217;s servant leadership), the low sample size is understandable (Carter &amp; Baghurst, 2014, p. 455).</li>
<li><em>Is the data collected appropriate?</em><br />
<strong>Rating: 3/3</strong><br />
Yes, the researcher discussed in detail how they aimed to collect the data as accurately as possible (Carter &amp; Baghurst, 2014). To ensure familiarity and comfort for the participants, the interviews were held at the participants&#8217; workplace (Carter &amp; Baghurst, 2014, p. 455). The interviews were held in two focus groups; one group of 5 and one group of 6 (Carter &amp; Baghurst, 2014, p. 455). A total of five questions were asked and each participant was given a chance to give their input (Carter &amp; Baghurst, 2014, p. 455).</li>
<li>Are the data gathered ethically and thoughtfully?<br />
<strong>Rating: 3/3</strong><br />
Yes, the authors assured participants that their responses would be kept confidential and a facilitator who was not connected to the restaurant was used for all interviews (Carter &amp; Baghurst, 2014, p. 455). Restaurant management gave permission for the data to be collected and participants were paid for their time during the interviews as part of their work day (Carter &amp; Baghurst, 2014, p. 455).</li>
</ol>
