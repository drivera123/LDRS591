<span style="font-weight: 400">As a consumer of research reports, the most important things for me in the introduction section of a high-quality research report are as follows:</span>

<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">That the subject matter is of interest to me;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">That the author provides a clear and concise purpose statement in the introduction (P184 of clark and creswell);</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">That the need for the research is clear;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">How the research will be conducted, ie. by what methodology; and,</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">The results discussion.</span></li>
</ol>

<span style="font-weight: 400">In the first few sentences of the introduction, the reader must become interested in the topic and must understand why there is a need for the research to be conducted in the first place. What exactly does the research hope to find or explain? Basically, the “so what?” question must be answered. The researcher must convince the reader that the study is important and is worthwhile.The reader must then understand what methodology will be used. There has to be a logical fit between what the purpose of the research is, and how the research will be conducted. The introduction should also identify who would benefit from the results of the study. Finally, the results should be presented as a brief summary.   </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Within the sample that the researchers used, they noted that servant leadership is most prevalent in education organizational settings. (Parris and Peachey, 2013, P 385).  My question is, is the servant leadership theory more applicable to organizations in certain economic sectors more than others?</span>
