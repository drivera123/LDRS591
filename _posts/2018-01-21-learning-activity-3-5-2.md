<span style="font-weight: 400">To our knowledge,this is the first study examining the influence of prenatal PCDD/F exposure on attention performance in school-aged children. We also analyzed associations between prenatal PCB and lead concentrations and the attention-related measures. At low environmental levels, we found significant associations with attention performance in healthy children, whereas ADHD-related behavior remained unchanged. Our results show that the associ-</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">ations of exposure to PCDD/Fs are – as expected – comparable to those of exposure to PCBs. Postnatal exposure through breastfeeding did not change the associations with attention performance. In addition, we provide evidence for the similar influence of BLLs on attention. In particular, we demonstrate the impact of prenatal lead exposure to be comparable to postnatal exposure. Although the sample size is limited, the longitudinal study design enables us to look at a possible link between prenatal PCDD/F, PCB and lead exposure and attention performance in children. Future analyses should consider incorporating a longitudinal exposure and outcome analysis design that make it easier to discriminate between prenatal and long-term postnatal exposure and to confirm attention performance in children. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">(Neugebauer, J.W., et al., 2015, p. 160).</span>
