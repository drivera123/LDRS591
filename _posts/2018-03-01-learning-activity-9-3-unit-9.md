<strong> </strong>

The most important thing for me about the conclusions section of a high-quality research report is . . .

&nbsp;

Interpreting and evaluating the results that answered research question are essential regarding conclusion section. However, the elements of conclusion section presented as follows

<strong>The summary of the significant results, </strong>Plano-Clerk &amp; Creswell (2015) stated, “when reading a conclusion section, a good first step is to look for statements where the researchers summarize the major findings of the study. Theses summary statement provides a recap of the key results that the researcher found in response to each of research questions” (p.467). The summary of the results includes the interpretation of the results in relation to the extensive literature and personal reflection about the results in addition to bringing in prior literature (Plano-Clerk &amp; Creswell, 2015, p.468). Also, the summary of findings is explicitly related to previous research as they compare to, contrast, or extend the prior study.

<strong>The implications for practice, </strong>that the researchers elicit in their conclusion for audiences based on the results obtained in the study., and how it provides the audiences with the possible outline of practices or expectations. “The researchers often elaborate on the implications of their study for audiences upon completion, the researchers are in a position to reflect and remark on how the different audiences may benefit from the use of results” (Plano-Clerk &amp; Creswell, 2015, p.468).

<strong>Thoughtful critique of the study’s limitation, </strong>the study limitations focused on shortcomings in the extent of the reasons that researchers chose to use specific research approach at the beginning of their research study.

<strong> </strong><strong>Future research suggestion, </strong>it’s also another type of interpretation based on the results and limitations that have to consider when conducting further research. It gives directions to researchers for strategies could be used to further the research.

<strong>Question</strong>

Is it possible to have a conflict of interest after the completion of the study achieved?
