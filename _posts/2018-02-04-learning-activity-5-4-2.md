As a consumer of research reports, the most important thing(s) for me in the methods and results section of a high-quality quantitative research report is clarity. It is important to note that I will be discussing more the methods section than the results section as it is this one that confuses me more.

The methods section of an article is the area that is most at risk of confusing readers. It is easy to get bogged down in numbers and statistical wordiness. I will be the first to admit that before this course I often simply skipped this section and went on to the conclusion to find what the results were. Needless to say, it can be difficult not to get lost in this section! Even the article I looked at for this unit had some areas that were a bit too muddled for me “Laub (1999) and Miears (2004) reported that the OLA had Cronbach’s alpha coefficients for the six subscales of 0.90 or above” (p. 609). This is why clarity in the methods section is so important. Authors and researchers should strive to speak in lamens terms and clarify terms that are not seen in the field. In this case, the authors should have clarified what mathematical significance the words ‘alpha coefficient’ and ‘subscales’ mean.

The question I would like to ask is the following: Is it absolutely necessary to comprehend the methods section when the conclusion has a better chance of clearly stating what the findings were and their implications? For years I have done this and while it might make me a bad student I certainly don’t lose any sleep at night when I don’t understand the exact procedures. Even if understanding the methods section means being able to critique the work I find that I fear running the risk of looking stupid if I criticize words I’m not even sure mean.
