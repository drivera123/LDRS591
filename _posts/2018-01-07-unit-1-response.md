This is in response to Leona’s post on learning activity 1.3-https://create.twu.ca/soleona/2018/01/07/ldrs591-unit-1-activity-1-3/

The question she invited for the further discussion is that where can be observed the negative results of the misinformation and what are the results. In my experience, misinformation mostly happens in the situation that people possess different perspectives or different worldview. There is a famous fable in China. It is about one people discussing with one animal if there are four seasons in one year. The animal strongly argued that there were only three seasons in a year for it could only survive from Spring to Autumn. A wise man passing by waked up the man that it was pointless to debate with the animal because it was hard to explain something which is totally beyond one&#8217;s cognition. In another word, they had a different worldview and different perspectives on the same thing. The result was also a sad one that neither of them could be persuaded by the other one. I like to use the word &#8220;sad&#8221; to describe my feelings toward this kind of results because there is no evident boundary between right and wrong in most of the situation. If the people on different perspectives of one thing cannot genuinely understand each other and reach to an agreement mutually, they will just stick to their own thoughts and accomplish the tasks or other things in their own ways.
