Barbuto, J. E., Gottfredson, R. K., &amp; Searle, T. P. (2014). An examination of emotional intelligence as an antecedent of servant leadership. <em>Journal of Leadership and Organizational Studies, 21</em>(3), 315-323.

<strong>Are the major results identified and summarized?</strong>

The results are identified and summarized in an organized way. The authors reiterate the research question and highlight the major findings of the study. No new findings are presented and the conclusion section has a logical flow.

Rating: 3

<strong>Are the results related to the literature?</strong>

Other studies are cited and used as a reference in the conclusion section. Personal reflection is given in this section as the author notes the importance of the findings even though they did not show a connection between emotional intelligence and servant-leader behaviours.

Rating: 3

<strong>Are appropriate implications of the results for practice identified and justified?</strong>

Appropriate implications of the result are given in the conclusion of the article. The conclusion notes that organizations looking to hire someone with a servant-leadership ideology could use the results of this study to inform their practice. Though the authors give some implications of the results, I think more could have been said about specific audiences who could benefit from the results.

Rating: 2

<strong>Is there a thoughtful critique of the study’s limitations?</strong>

The conclusion does a great job of identifying the limitations of the study. The authors acknowledge the specifics of the leaders they sampled, as well as the sample size of followers limited the findings of the study.

Rating: 3

<strong>Are suitable suggestions for future research provided?</strong>

Suggestions for future research are given and these suggestions flow logically from the study&#8217;s limitations. More suggestions for research could have been provided, given the results of the study. A suggestion for what else could be an antecedent of servant leadership would have helped.
