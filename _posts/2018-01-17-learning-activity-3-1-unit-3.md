<strong>Introduction:</strong> Conflict is negative in nature, and the resolution is positive regarding leadership style or orientation. Servant leaders resolve conflict through adopted peaceful means considering human elements and dignity. The orientation service of Servant leaders motivated by the need to serve pro-followers, and bring success to the organization, the subordinate which reflects on serving the community.<strong> </strong>Servant leader uses the power as a tool to serve the others as Dirk Van Dierendonck(2001) (p.595) puts it this way “Being a servant allows a person to lead; being a leader implies a person to serve.”

&nbsp;

<strong>Methodology:</strong> The study used the method of narrative inquiry to discover the deep values of servant leaders and their perspectives to their subordinates in the context of a conflict situation. The study conducted 15 semi-structured interviews, three of the respondents were from the education sector, four from the corporate sector and the remaining eight were from the public sector. Gender- base selection was; ten male and five female leaders in the age of 45-65 interviewed. Eight-ten subordinates and colleagues of each leader interviewed. The open-ended questions were designed to have in-depth understanding of leaders ‘personal experiences, and their perspectives regarding situations suggested by scholars with experts in qualitative research methods.(p.597,598)

<strong>Data analysis</strong><em>:</em> The researchers adopted two approaches; sententious approach and selective approach to identifying the theme then evaluations. Each transcript examined the essential meaning of respondents’ experience. The study applied the use of thought and language to depict the better understanding in how the respondent’s experience in resolving situations lived precisely. The qualitative study evaluated comfortability, dependability, credibility, transferability, and the assumptions were examined not to be biased. (p.599,600)

&nbsp;

<strong>Results:</strong> the findings outlined two domains of conflict resolutions presented in the servant leaders reactions and perception as well as their approach toward managing these situations. Servant leaders adopted strategies in resolving subordinate-subordinate conflict through thoroughly “diagnosis of the conflict situation” (p.600) which applies active listening, discussion, and understanding, which can bring the collaborative approach to conflict resolution. The servant leaders intervene conflict by capturing the “positive” of each viewpoint to facilitate “an amicable solution” for the situation. (p.602). They empower their employee in a way nobody has a hard feeling about it. In the notion of harmony and cohesion in the organization, servant leaders’ intentions to resolve a conflict by being impartial and objective. (p.603). Eight respondent exhibit more human approach to resolve interpersonal differences between their employee by using term “understanding” as the first step in conflict resolution. (p.604)

When the subordinate indulges provocative behavior, servant leaders apply their strategies “Active listening, discussion, understanding” with self-restraint, patience, and composure. Seven out of fifteen respondent reportedly exhibited these characteristics. (p.605).

&nbsp;

<strong>Conclusion:</strong> The study emphasizes the relationship between leadership characteristics, behavior and value orientations for better understanding the strategies of conflict resolution adopted by servant leaders. The conflict-resolution approach of the respondents manifests a leadership style presented in being supportive, cooperative, benevolent, relational, and persuasive. This leadership orientation has potential to give rise to a culture of civility, collaboration, compassion, and forgiveness. (p.609)

<strong>Personal comment</strong>: This study implicit positively close attention to my research question of conflict resolution in the workplace to find out conflict management strategies that affect Trainee (employee) deal with conflict in the workplace. My finding is promoting “Active listening and appreciating interpersonal differences in their perspectives.” will add more values that adhere to the organizational perspectives to cultivate sustainability and productivity.
