Jones, D. (2012). DOES SERVANT LEADERSHIP LEAD TO GREATER CUSTOMER FOCUS AND EMPLOYEE SATISFACTION?. <i>Business Studies Journal</i>, <i>4</i>(2), 21-35.

<strong>Did the researcher(s) use at least three strategies to validate the findings?</strong>

The researchers used a number of strategies to validate their findings, including bracketing, meaning units, textural descriptions and structural descriptions. Out of the 21 participants, 12 completed member checking. The strategies used in the article were borrowed from a previous Creswell (2007) text.

Rating: 3

<strong>Did the findings include a good description of the people, places, or events in the study?</strong>

There was very little information regarding the people or context of the study. The participants current roles were given with some context as to why they were chosen, but almost no other information was given. The article did not include tables or quotes from participants and details were extremely lacking. Participants responses were conveyed generally though not in detail and actions words were limited.

Rating: 1

<strong>Did the findings include appropriate themes about the central phenomenon?</strong>

There were seven themes given in the findings. All of these themes related well to the central phenomenon. There were no subthemes listed. Only common perspectives were given with no quotations to support it. Some literary devices were used but no tables for comparison were provided. Multiple perspectives were provided more than once in the findings.

Rating: 2

<strong>Did the findings provide a good exploration of the central phenomenon?</strong>

The findings definitely provided information to answer the study&#8217;s questions. The findings could have been explained more thoroughly but all of the findings connected to the study&#8217;s purpose and provided data to make clear conclusions from. Each theme explored a slightly different aspect of the central phenomenon but all of the themes helped explore the question more thoroughly.
