<ul>
<li><strong>Are the major results identified and summarized?</strong></li>
</ul>

The summary of the key results was organized logically by theme which in regards answer their research questions. They didn’t introduce new results. The results highlighted the eight-servant leadership characteristics, competencies, the outcomes related to individual, team, and organization. Coetzer, Bussin, &amp; Geldenhuys, (2017) stated, “The results were used to identify four general functions of a servant leader clustered into strategic servant leadership and operational servant leadership. Each function was supported by competencies and characteristics of a servant leader as defined in current literature” (p.19).

Rate 3

<ul>
<li><strong>Are the results related to the literature?</strong></li>
</ul>

Coetzer, et.al., (2017) acknowledged “The purpose of this study was to discover the characteristics, competencies, measures, and outcomes of servant leadership by means of a systematic literature review.” The results are thoughtfully examined in relation to previous literature, and they were all based on quantitative, qualitative, and literature. This study made a theoretical and practical contribution to the body of knowledge related to servant leadership Coetzer, et.al.,2017, p.19)

Rate 3

<ul>
<li><strong>Are appropriate implications of the results for practice identified and justified</strong>?</li>
</ul>

Suggestion for practice that clearly stems from the study, and the specific audiences that might benefit from the knowing the results of the study are clearly noted. “The results of this study provide managers and practitioners with a possible outline to develop servant leaders within organizations” (Coetzer, et.al.,2017, p.19). they also indicated the importance of implication of this study also can be used to design curriculums for servant leadership development programmes and to cultivate a servant leadership culture within an organization. In return, management and other stakeholders could expect favorable individual, team, or organizational outcomes that servant leadership produces (Coetzer, et.al.,2017, p.19).

Rate 3

<ul>
<li><strong>Is there a thoughtful critique of the study’s limitations?</strong></li>
</ul>

Thoughtful critique of the study’s limitations is provided. Coetzer, et.al., (2017) mentioned, “Normally a systematic literature review is done by at least two researchers, especially the evaluation of the quality of articles. In this study, however, only one researcher evaluated the quality of studies,” also, “the study excluded studies done before the year 2000 and after 2015 as well as research done in the quaternary sector,” and “it excluded grey literature, books, book reviews, magazine articles, conference presentations, and white papers” (p.19).

Rate 3

<ul>
<li><strong>Are suitable suggestions for future research provided?</strong></li>
</ul>

Suggestion for future research that clearly built from the study’s results and limitation are advanced. Coetzer, et.al., (2017) proposed “future study might be to design a leadership development programme based on functions and performance areas mentioned in this study and to test its effectiveness to enhance servant leadership attributes. Experimental type studies might be valuable in this regard.” Also, “The functions and performance areas of a servant leader may also help to create serving organizations, organizations that leave behind legacies in individuals and the community throughout its existence. Action research and case studies might validate this possibility” (p.19).

Rate 3

<ul>
<li><strong>Is the interpretation consistent with the study?</strong></li>
</ul>

The researchers draw conclusions that logical extension of the results to address the study’s purpose and research questions

Rate 3

<ul>
