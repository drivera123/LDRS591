Hello, my name is Heather Strong. I have been an instructor in the MA Lead Program at TWU since December of 2016. I currently live in Nelson British Columbia (the interior of BC in the snowy Selkirk mountains).  I have four children that range in age from 4-13 and my husband Jeff works for the Nelson Evangelical Covenant Church.  In my spare time I enjoy running, cross-fit, and hiking in the mountains!
