I do not have an example of a study in recent times that had ethical concerns around it. In medical literature I have read studies which have been terminated pre maturely when one arm ( control or study group) was identified as statistically significant from the intervention or lack thereof. In my  limited experience with research during my residency and fellowship training I learnt about IRB ( Institutional review boards) . I assume this applies to individual institutions. I wonder if there is bigger governing body that all researchers are answerable to if their research involves human subjects. I guess my question here is if someone with a non institutional affiliation were to do research with human subjects, under whose purview does the ethical regulation of that research fall?
