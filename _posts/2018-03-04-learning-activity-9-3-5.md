The most important part of a conclusion section in high-quality research for me are the following elements:

The results are clearly identified and summarized. It is essential to summarize the results that are critical to answering the original research question. If further results were found because of the research but do not directly answer the research question, they need to be organized and summarized logically.

The results are examined in the literature. It is crucial the researcher notes how their results are related to prior research

that the implication of the findings for practice is identified and justified. Next, it is essential the researcher indicates how their results compare to prior research. I believe it is crucial to include the implications of the study to ensure the study is used and does not sit on a shelf collecting dust, after all, that is why we conduct research.

Thoughtful critiques of the study’s limitation are noted. Another way to contribute to the world of research is to critique your research by examining the limitation of the study to provide a suggestion for future research based not only on the results but also to address the limitations.

Discussion Question(s):

How important do you feel the personal reflection in the conclusion section is? Is it fair to examine researcher’s personal reflection for any biases or presuppositions that may not have been revealed throughout the study? How can personal reflection add value to the study and literature in general?
