<h3>Conclusions of Research Reports</h3>

The most important thing for me about the conclusions section of a high-quality research report is that the finding(s) in the study, have been thoughtfully examined in relation to existing literature.

&nbsp;

This is informed from my understanding that research is meant to add to knowledge about a topic (Plano-Clark, &amp; Creswell, 2015, p. 467). Plano-Clark &amp; Creswell (2015) further explained that in order to add to existing knowledge about a topic, a study should conclude by interpreting how its finding(s) are similar to, different from, or extend ideas already found in theories or existing literature. This is the whole point of research! In addition, I believe that without this, a research would not be different than an essay.

&nbsp;

In furtherance of the above, I also think that although the summary of major results, implications for practice, and others noted by Plano-Clark, &amp; Creswell (2015), are important, it is more important that the researcher helps their readers to better appreciate their finding(s) by noting possible limitations/weaknesses that might exist with their study. This would provide a better context that would aid the readers’ assessment of the finding(s). For example, if a quantitative study reports that a random sample was not used, it would be a lot easier for the readers to realise that its finding(s) cannot be generalized, and additional research on the topic/problem, could be needed in future.

&nbsp;

<h5><strong>Question:</strong></h5>

I would like to know if a quantitative research should as a rule, exclude the researchers’ personal reflections. Although this was explained by Plano-Clark, &amp; Creswell (2015, p. 468), it was not explicitly if, personal reflections should only be included in qualitative, action research, or mixed methods research alone.
