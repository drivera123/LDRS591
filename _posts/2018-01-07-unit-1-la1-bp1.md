<strong>My Research Experiences</strong>

My main research experience comes from my undergraduate degree in Secondary Physical Education. I wrote a thesis on the quality of initial teacher training in preparing trainee teachers to teach physical education to students with special needs within the United Kingdom. This involved interviewing six participants and doing literacy review of studies already undertaken. Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015) define this type of work as critique or analysis around a specific topic.

My other main experiences have been as a participant in research studies especially around technology integration within physical education. This has taken many forms including face to face interviews and questionnaires. I never turn down an opportunity to be involved in research.

<strong>My Leadership Decision</strong>

As an athletic director, I get the task of selecting coaching teams for our varsity and middle school sports every year. When I first arrived in my current position because of the size of the school and some historical events coaches selected themselves based on interest. I identified early that we were at a stage of growth in the school where we had to try and move away from this and appoint coaches based more on experience and level they have played the sport to help ensure further success of our sporting teams.

To implement these changes I had to update and evaluate current policy, seek advice and opinion from my line manager as well as collect a consensus from my coaches. I felt the change was necessary based on my need for fairness and transparency. I also sought some advice from our sister schools. In my opinion, gaining a breadth of view from a variety of sources made the transition to the new policy a lot smoother. It was apparent to everyone that the decision hadn&#8217;t been taken lightly and this helped it be accepted quickly.
