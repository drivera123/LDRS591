<strong>As a consumer of research reports, the most important thing(s) for me in the introduction section of a high-quality research report is/are . .</strong> .

One of the things I always look for in the introduction section of an article is a reason for the study. If I can identify why the research and study on any given topic is needed then I am much more likely to continue reading. It is easy to list the purpose, participants and method of a study but without identifying a clear problem &#8211; even if that is simply a lack of research &#8211; it is difficult to continue reading and I find myself getting bored quickly.

Secondly, I often look for the implications of the study or report. If the article can give a brief overview of the implications then I can decide whether it is worth reading to the end.

Finally, when I am researching biblical topics or ideas, I often look for the author&#8217;s bias in the introduction. For example, it is helpful to know when an author is writing from a reformed perspective. Often, the author will state this in the introduction but sometimes it takes more research on the author in order to determine their particular theological perspective. In my opinion, the best biblical articles are the ones that give commentary on an issue from a variety of perspectives, rather than focusing solely on one particular perspective. This allows the reader to think more critically of a topic and decide which interpretation or application is best. It also gives the author more credibility as the reader can then be certain multiple opinions have been examined.

What is one thing that acts as a &#8220;deal-breaker&#8221; for you in the introduction of an article? What is one thing that a researcher may say that would stop you from reading beyond the introduction?
