Book:<em> Building happiness, resilience and motivation in adolescents: a positive curriculum for well-being </em>

<em><a href="http://library.twu.ca/uhtbin/cgisirsi.exe/?ps=hh2hGe1xEF/MAIN/44100069/9">http://library.twu.ca/uhtbin/cgisirsi.exe/?ps=hh2hGe1xEF/MAIN/44100069/9</a></em>

Authors: Ruth MacConville, Tina Rae

Publisher: Jessica Kingsley Publishers

Date: 2012

Dr Ruth MacConville is an educational consultant and author. She had worked as head of the SEN specialist teaching teams in the London Borough of Ealing. She has published extensively on topics that promote well-being and motivation in young people, and she regularly contributes to national conferences (&#8220;Mental health and well-being&#8221;).

Dr Tina Rae specializes in social, emotional and behavioural disorders and difficulties. She is also a prolific author and has written extensively on topics such as wellbeing, attachment, emotional literacy, behavioural problems, anger and stress management, critical incidents, cognitive behavioural therapy and so on. Tina is a member of SEBDA’s council and executive, also a member of the European Network for Social and Emotional Competence (ENSEC) and a trustee of the Nurture Group Network (NGN) (&#8220;University of East London&#8221;)

This book is published in 2012, and it is the latest edition. The publisher, Jessica Kingsley Publishers, was founded in 1987 in London by Jessica Kingsley. It claims that &#8220;We publish books for professionals and general readers in a range of subjects. &#8221; (&#8220;Jessica Kingsley Publishers&#8221;). Also, I believe that this book has been peer-reviewed because the Jessica Kingsley Publishers specifically requests the author to provide the names and contact details of at least two individuals qualified to peer review the manuscript before the publication of the book (&#8220;Jessica Kingsley Publishers&#8221;).

Both of the two authors are dedicating their effort to focusing on and trying to solve the mental issues of the youth. After a quick review of the book, I found out that not only has this book offered a set of pragmatic programme, but also it has thoroughly illustrated the various aspects which play as the underpinnings of the programme. I deemed that the authors wanted to introduce the notion &#8220;positive psychology&#8221; and demonstrate how to help adolescents apply the programme (or approach) to solving the mental issues and pursuing happiness. As far as I am concerned, this book is related to my research question &#8220;How to effectively help the students in the elementary school (or post-secondary school) manage their anxiety disorders and academic performance at the same time&#8221;. I think that anxiety disorders mostly derive from the negative thoughts, worries or self-aggression. Part two of this book has provided the knowledge of the components which are contributed to positive mental health. Especially chapter 4 love of learning, chapter 6 authenticity, and chapter 7 bravery are all perfect for me to analyze how to deal with anxiety disorders. So, besides the people who are interested in exploring this kind of topic, like me, the parents of the adolescents, other professors and scholars in this field should all be counted as the intended audience. And there is no obvious bias found in this book.
