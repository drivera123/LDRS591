This is my response to <a href="https://create.twu.ca/icandothis/2018/01/02/activity-1-2/">Simarjit Shergill&#8217;s Learning Activity 1.2 blog post</a>.

Hi Simarjit,

As a teacher, I imagine I face many of the same issues you do where personal values and beliefs conflict with organizational policy and expectations. I read in one of your comments that in situations like this, you follow organizational policy rather than your own personal beliefs. I agree with you that as public servants, we are bound by our professional duty to follow the guidelines set not only by our organization, but often by laws and legal processes set by the government. Still, I often struggle with finding a sense of peace and balance between my more conservative worldview and the controversial and liberal changes in society. Usually when issues like this come up, I try to avoid or opt out of the situation whenever possible. However, as society continues to change and become more liberal, I do feel like I need to be able to face issues more head-on without avoiding every controversial topic that comes up. Recently in my classroom and with my colleagues, I have taken a more open approach about my personal beliefs and religion. I let my coworkers and students know my Christian background. Without passing judgement on any issues, I plainly state facts as is required of me in my position. I am open to discussion when students have more questions and I make sure I maintain an open and friendly conversation with the students.

Thank you for your post, Simarjit! I look forward to learning with you again this course :).

Ruth
