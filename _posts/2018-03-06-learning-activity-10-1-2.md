<strong>I want to know, if after taking this class, would you make your decisions differently? What new insights have you learned and how would those insights inform your decision making process now?</strong>

One thing that has stood out to me over the last ten weeks is the number and variety of studies there are. As we have looked through research reports and analyzed them I have been repeatedly surprised with how many good studies have been done on fascinating topics. Knowing this, I am going to utilize these studies as I continue to grow in my leadership. When I need to make a big decision I will look to see whether there are studies that could help me as I process and determine the best decision.

For smaller, day-to-day decisions the thing I will take from this course is that each person brings a unique perspective to a situation. And in fact, there is not always one perspective or decision that is &#8220;right.&#8221; Taking time to listen to others, gather their perspectives and sort through those perspectives is a small but important thing that will inform my decision making. It is easy to dismiss others opinions because we feel they are uninformed or different than our own, yet each person views a situation differently and there is collective wisdom that can be fostered through listening and gathering others&#8217; perspectives.
