For me, the most important part of the conclusions section of a high-quality research report is significance and summary. In other words, having at least one or two strong sentences that wrap up both the findings and clarify what the implications of said findings are.

There have been some reports that I have read that seem too intent on relating their findings to the real world in a symbolic or philosophical way. As an example, the article that I read for my 9.2 post had a great conclusion, but it easily could have been weak. Instead of summarizing accurately, the article easily could have droned on about the importance of servant leadership in the field of education and how it strengthens relationships of all kinds. Thankfully, the authors did not do this in their conclusion. Alternatively, they gave sentences that were to the point, “Our findings suggest that emotional intelligence is a good predictor of a leader’s servant-leader ideology, but it is not a predictor of actual servant-leader behaviors as rated by followers” (Barbuto, Gottfredson, &amp; Searle, 2014, p. 322).

The significance of an article is an important part of both quantitative and qualitative conclusions. As our textbook notes, qualitative conclusions include personal reflections and summary by themes whereas qualitative conclusions give more predictions and summary by hypothesis (Plano-Clark &amp; Creswell, 2015, p.472). However, both require being tied to an overall meaning of the study. A significance is important because it can show readers how information can be used and what it means as far as implications go. As a consumer, if a significance is not given I often find the overall point of an article moot.
