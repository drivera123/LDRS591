What was the purpose of the study?

The purpose of the study was to determine, “whether a servant leader can develop a corporate culture that attracts or develops other servant leaders” (Melchar &amp; Bosco, 2010, p. 74). It was clear and easy to find.

3/3

Is there a rationale provided for needing a mixed methods design?

The researchers do not explicitly state their study was using a mixed methods design, but it became apparent when reading the methods section.

2/3

Is the choice of the mixed methods design appropriate and justified?

Yes. The researcher&#8217;s goal was to use qualitative and quantitative methods to compliment each other and provide a fuller picture.

2/3

What are the results of the study?

The researchers concluded modeling “servant leadership by strategic level managers can create an organizational culture in which servant leaders develop among lower-level managers” (Melchar &amp; Bosco, 2010, p.84).

2/3

Does the use of mixed methods produce a good understanding of the study’s purpose?

I believe the intent was there, but it was not without limitations which the authors did acknowledge. It was necessary to collect the qualitative data before collecting and analyzing the quantitative data. It would be interesting to see this study repeated on a larger scale and in a variety of industries.
