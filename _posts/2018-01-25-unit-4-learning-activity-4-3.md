Article : <em>Servant leaders inspire servant followers: Antecedents and outcomes for employees and the organization</em>

<strong>Quality Criteria</strong>

1.The review includes the relevant literature.

<strong>Rate</strong>

3=Excellent

<strong>Evidence and/or Reasoning</strong>

<ol>
<li>There are more than 19 literatures providing important background information of theories and analyses of servant leadership.</li>
<li>There are more than eight literatures presenting as supporting basis and models tested by other researchers. The authors depict a figure as the proposed model expanding upon and building on those models provided by other researchers.</li>
<li>At last, the authors illustrate eight literatures to introduce the deficiency of the servant leader personality.</li>
</ol>

<strong>Quality Criteria</strong>

2.The review examines sources that are recent and of high quality.

<strong>Rate</strong>

2=Good

<strong>Evidence and/or Reasoning</strong>

All of the literature in this journal article are of high quality, while I identified about nine literatures which were published before 2000. I believe some of them are necessary, for example, the definition of servant leadership is printed in Greenleaf’s seminal essay published in 1991. The Greenleaf’s essay is the most profound literature of servant leadership, and nearly every article about servant leadership will introduce this one.

<strong>Quality Criteria</strong>

3.The literature review is appropriately documented.

<strong>Rate</strong>

3=Excellent

<strong>Evidence and/or Reasoning</strong>

<ol>
<li>All the citations are in correct format, both in-text references and end-of-text references.</li>
<li>All the citations are provided as sound support for the ideas.</li>
</ol>

<strong>Quality Criteria</strong>

4.The literature is thoughtfully synthesized.

<strong>Rate</strong>

3=Excellent

<strong>Evidence and/or Reasoning</strong>

The authors create two subtitles to organize and synthesize the literature which are easy to grasp the theme and clear to identify a visual map

<ol>
<li>Servant leadership as a construct</li>
<li>Servant leadership and the cycle of service</li>
</ol>

<strong>Quality Criteria</strong>

5.The literature is critically examined.

<strong>Rate</strong>

2=Good

<strong>Evidence and/or Reasoning</strong>

The authors use most of the literature as sound basis for providing background and what have been done by other researchers step by step. And the authors expand their hypothesis on the deficiencies of the previous literature.

<strong>Quality Criteria</strong>

6.The study has a strong foundation in the literature.

<strong>Rate</strong>

3=Excellent

<strong>Evidence and/or Reasoning</strong>

<ol>
<li>This study’s problem, purpose, approach and method are clearly and closely connected to the literature.</li>
<li>It is easy to find out how the literature is being used in the study to generate hypothesis and to provide a guiding theory.</li>
</ol>

<strong>Quality Criteria</strong>

7.The use of the literature fits the study’s overall research approach.

<strong>Rate</strong>

3=Excellent

<strong>Evidence and/or Reasoning</strong>

As a qualitative study, the literature review states the deficiency, presents the approach and purpose for the researcher, predicts the new findings.

<strong>Total Score = 19 (17-21 = High quality)</strong>
