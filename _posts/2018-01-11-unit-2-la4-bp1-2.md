Published three years ago the source is still considered current for relevant research.

<strong>Purpose – What are the intentions of the author? Who is the intended audience?</strong>

The author states the purpose of the publication is to further enhance knowledge of psychological aspects associated with the practice of coaching and management. This e-book is a collection of current research from a variety of leading experts in this field. Representing a plethora of countries around the world including the USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Sweden, Spain, Greece, Croatia and the UK. The target audience includes students, researchers, practitioners, educators, and administrators. (Davis, 2015).
