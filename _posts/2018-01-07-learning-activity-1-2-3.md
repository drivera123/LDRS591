<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">I believe that the most influential factors in my decision-making process are my own personal values, policies that are in place, past experiences, and the knowledge and advice that I seek from people that are experienced and that I trust. When faced with decision making I first look to policy to see what I am professionally obligated to do. Then, I often make lists of pros and cons of the decisions I could make. These lists include the effects the decision will have on other people and whether or not it is true to my values and beliefs. When I am faced with difficult decisions, I often seek advice from people whom I trust. These people include family members, colleagues whom I know have been faced with similar decisions, and my administration team. All of these people are experienced and have valuable advice to offer. </span></li>

<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">I agree with the proposition that is made in the course notes that one’s worldview influences the types of questions that a person will ask. I experience this everyday in my profession. Young children ask questions based on their personal experiences and based on things that connect to their worldviews. They ask questions based on things that they have seen or experienced and that they want to know more about. People try to make sense of new information by connecting it to their own worldview to see how it fits in with their view. </span></li>

<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Can our own worldview’s create a personal bias that would skew our research results? Would our reading, analyzing and research be stronger if our personal worldview’s were not a factor?</span></li>
