This week we are going to begin learning about the different sections of research reports and begin exploring the research that has been published on servant leadership.  In unit 4 we will start right at the very beginning – the introduction.  In this unit we will unpack the three common elements in the introduction of a research report including: the research problem, the literature review and the research purpose.  The learning activities this week are geared toward evaluating the elements of an introduction section of a research report, appraising types of research problems for suitability to quantitative or qualitative studies, and examining the origin, development and application of servant leadership.

If you have any questions about the learning activities this week, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Dr. Strong
