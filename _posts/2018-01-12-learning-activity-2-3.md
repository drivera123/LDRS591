This film, based on the life of an American War Veteran, went to extensive lengths to portray the military and personal life of an extraordinary individual torn between family and duty. The purpose of this review and critical analysis is to note the leadership theory and approaches that examined the Navy S.E.A.L Chris Kyle in the film “American Sniper.”

As a military-based show, this film naturally falls into the areas of dedication, sacrifice, and moral ethics, which can be considered significant capacities of the leadership paradigm.

The author made a point of view that “American Sniper was limited when it came to the style approach as it could show task behaviors well, but not so much with relationship behaviors.”

The military theme in the film influenced “Authority” in a frame that has a picture of the military is good in executing the mission, and subordinates.. are told what to do.  Hence the relationship in this film is obedience-oriented, which preferred in this situation. Also, The film reiterate some old approaches, such trait approach still relevant and in conjunction with their instance and requires consideration of Individuals’  perceptions and subjective apprehension.

Generally speaking, Based on what medium leadership presents in the organization, it may differ to an extent, but pertinent to a successful individual in command who use them in some forms.

This study examined the film American Sniper through various leadership theories and approaches and found that all theories called upon sufficiently shown and used by the main character. These concepts and approaches classified as the following: trait approach, skills approach, style approach, situational approach, and path-goal theory. It was no biased to any stream of conduct and applies to all.

I enjoyed reading this article; in fact, I want to clarify more in research interest since I want to replace the word of &#8220;subordinate&#8221; with &#8220;followers&#8221;
