Hi Everyone,

<strong>The</strong> <strong>fourth assignment</strong> that you will need to complete for LDRS 591 is the literature review outline for your final paper.  Your outline is due by the end of day on Sunday February 25.  I wanted to provide you with some suggestions about this assignment (from my 591 face to face class).

<ul>
<li>On average it took the students 4-6 hours to complete the literature review outline assignment.</li>
<li>The face to face class found that because they had not read all of the articles yet that they were not able to answer all of the questions provided on the outline assignment. Specifically, there were questions in the results and discussion section of the outline assignment that they were not able to address.  That is ok!</li>
<li>If you have not completed your critical evaluation or thought through how to present your results then I would recommend that you just make a note in each of these sections of the outline assignment that you will address these sections in the final paper.</li>
<li>The purpose of the outline assignment is just so that I can see the structure of your paper, and provide you with feedback, before you write it.</li>
</ul>

<strong>The</strong> <strong>final assignment</strong> is due on March 23rd. Here are a few questions about the final paper that my face to face class had, and here are some helpful resources I have put together for you:

<ol>
<li><em><strong>What is a literature review?</strong></em>  Here is a really helpful website that explains what a formal literature review paper is: <a href="http://libguides.usc.edu/writingguide/literaturereview">http://libguides.usc.edu/writingguide/literaturereview</a></li>
<li><em><strong>What type or style of literature review are you supposed to write? </strong></em>The &#8220;type&#8221; or &#8220;style&#8221; of literature review that I am asking you to write for your fifth assignment is called a systematic literature review.  You can find an excellent example of this type of literature review paper here: <a href="https://ezproxy.student.twu.ca/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=bth&amp;AN=87015717&amp;site=eds-live">Parris, D. L., &amp; Peachy, J. W. (2013). A systematic review of servant leadership theory in organizational contexts. Journal of Business Ethics, 113(3), 377-395.</a>  This article is available through the TWU online library.</li>
<li><em><strong>How should we write a systematic literature review? </strong></em>Here is a really helpful document that describes how to write your systematic literature review:<a href="http://create.twu.ca/drheatherstrong/files/2018/02/WHAT-IS-A-SYSTEMATIC-LITERATURE-REVIEW-AND-HOW-DO-I-DO-ONE.pdf">WHAT IS A SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW AND HOW DO I DO ONE</a></li>
<li>I have also prepared a slide presentation (that I have narrated) that outlines specific tips for your final paper.  You can find the slide presentation here:<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/bzv5f470rmpre96/Final%20Paper.pptx?dl=0">https://www.dropbox.com/s/bzv5f470rmpre96/Final%20Paper.pptx?dl=0</a></li>
</ol>

<strong>Please note:</strong>

<ul>
<li>I am NOT asking you to review ALL of the empirical evidence on your topic (this would be a huge undertaking).  I am asking you to select a minimum of 10 scholarly sources that you will use to review for your paper.  This means you are writing a mini-systematic review.</li>
<li>I am also NOT asking you to do a meta-analysis (which involves statistics).</li>
</ul>
