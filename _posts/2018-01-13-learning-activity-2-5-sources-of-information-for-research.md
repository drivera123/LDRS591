<h3>Learning Activity 2.5 Most Used Sources for Research</h3>

In my bachelors degree in history most of my research focused on primary and secondary source books. I did try and use journal articles to better understand opinions on historical events but the majority of my research was in primary source books where I made opinions based on my understanding of the authors bias. I used secondary source books to help me when I could not understand author bias and motivation, and to give me better context. While this was a reasonably successful method of research for a bachelors degree in history, it was not particularly useful in my degree in education.

In my bachelors degree in education I mostly used academic journals and peer edited articles to help with my understanding of new pedagogical concepts and how they are implemented in real world education. I expect this method of research will be the most prevalent in my masters degree in education, mostly due to the fact that articles are often more current and provide a variety of opinions on a subject.

While google has been my goto search engine for everyday research and note taking to problem solve and further develop my curriculum at work, I would like to use the database of articles accessed through TWU library more than I have in the past. I have used google scholar in the previous leadership course and found it a very useful search engine. Some journals found in my research process that I feel will be especially useful to my research are:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/zrlt20/current">Research in Learning Technology</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.ifets.info/issues.php">Journal of Educational Technology and Society</a></li>
<li><a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/(ISSN)1467-8535">British Journal of Educational Technology</a></li>
<li><a href="https://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/11528">TechTrends</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.journals.elsevier.com/computers-in-human-behavior">Computers In Human Behaviour</a></li>
</ul>

While this is by no means a comprehensive list of journals that I will be using to find peer reviewed articles it is the first step in that process. While searching through these sources I will be sure to evaluate their authenticity, bias and usefulness through questioning and evaluation. I will look at journal metrics for cite score, author statistics, impact factors, etc. I will assess author motivation and intent by seeking to understand their bias.

<h3>Discussion Question:</h3>

While preforming the tasks assigned in unit 2 I learnt that using the $ symbol in the TWU search engine <a href="https://vimeo.com/164163119/b24ecb42e6">searches for all possible word endings</a>. Previously I have used short cuts like filetype: or &#8220;&#8221; in google to adjust search functionality. Do you have any other search shortcuts that you find particularly useful?
