<span style="font-weight: 400">The e-book I have found for this learning activity is </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Hope for the autism spectrum [electronic resource] : a mother and son journey of insight and biomedical intervention. The author of this books is Sally Kirk. It was published by Jessica Kingsley out of London, Philadelphia in 2008, c2009. </span><a href="http://library.twu.ca/uhtbin/cgisirsi.exe/?ps=pDd8hy8duD/MAIN/16210070/9"><span style="font-weight: 400">http://library.twu.ca/uhtbin/cgisirsi.exe/?ps=pDd8hy8duD/MAIN/16210070/9</span></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The author, Sally Kirk, is a mother of a son who has been diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder. When her son was diagnosed, she took it upon herself to learn all that she possibly could about treatment and therapy for this disorder.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">In this book, the author intended to share her family&#8217;s experience with Autism Spectrum Disorder. She intends to target other families who may be experiencing similar situations.The book provides a wealth of information on biomedical interventions for ASD. Her information is intended to target family’s, physiologists, practitioners and pediatricians who may be able to share the information with other families as well.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">This book is published in 2008 and copyright in 2009. According to the Unit 2 notes, this follows the general rule that a source published within the last 10 years is up to date.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">I found it more difficult to determine if the e-book is peer reviewed. I do not believe it is peer reviewed. You can find reviews of the book online, written by authors of other books on similar subjects and founders of recognized societies such as the Autism Society of America, and the Director of the Autism Research Institute.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The book may have biases in that it is a personal experience told from Sally Kirk. Her experiences may not be the same for others in similar situations. </span>
