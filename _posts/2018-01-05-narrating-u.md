I have decided to organize my site using categories and tags as recommended. I used this set-up previously and I believe that is the most efficient for me.

I have decided to also add menus to my site. I have title them by course name, which I hope will help me when searching for old posts and adding new ones.

I had some difficulty adding the menus and had to watch the orientation video a second time, but I think I&#8217;ve got it set up correctly now. When I would create the menus and click publish, I would get an error message that said I did not have the ability to customize this site. I just continued to try and it eventually let me.

I believe that using categories and tags will be the most effective, however, if I go through the course and find otherwise, I will further customize my page.
