<span style="font-weight: 400">The most important thing for me about the conclusions section of a high-quality research report is a clear and organized summary of results and that the researcher carefully examines and relates the results to the literature. Plano-Clark and Creswell, 2015, say that the researcher should explicitly relate the results, as well as compare and contrast the results to prior research. (Plano-Clark and Creswell, 2015, P 476). By comparing the results to other, current research, this shows that the researcher is knowledgeable in the area of research. This improves the quality of the research and makes it more meaningful to the reader to know that the researcher has a strong content knowledge of other research on the topic.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">This part of the conclusion is the most important for me as it allows me to have a clear understanding of the results of the research. Personally, I find other parts of a research article can be difficult to understand and at times, even confusing. Having little experience with statistics and reading data, I find it can be difficult for me. A well-written conclusion is crucial to my comprehension of the results and research. The researcher must include a description of how the results compare to predictions made by the researcher in order to provide a more clear understanding of how these results can be used for future research. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Even if the research contradicts the predictions of the researcher or the found results are unforeseen, it is important for the researcher to provide the reader with a clear and detailed explanation and relate it to the literature.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">A clear and organized summary that relates the results to the literature will allow the reader to rate the importance of the research and decide whether or not the research is practical in their own practice. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">If you found a research article that was significant and read to the conclusion to find that it is not clear and well written, would this impact the significance of the research? Would you still reference it?</span>
