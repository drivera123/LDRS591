Beck, C. D. (2014). Antecedents of servant leadership: A mixed methods study. <em>Journal of Leadership and Organizational Studies, 21</em>(3), 299-314.

<strong>What was the purpose of the study?</strong>

The absent of empirical studies on the antecedents of servant leadership was the purpose of this study (Beck, C. D., 2014, p.299)

<strong>Is there a rationale provided for needing a mixed methods design?</strong>

Beck, C. D., (2014) noted in his study that, “Given the complexities of leadership, quantitative results may be inadequate; therefore, qualitative data are needed to help explain initial quantitative data. The combination of quantitative and qualitative data should provide a complete picture and a “voice of the participants” (p.302). The author follows Creswell and Plano Clark (2007) suggestion, using quantitative data are inadequate in addressing the domain of leadership.

<strong>Did the quantitative method are of good quality based on the standard of quantitative research?</strong>

All the criterions have chosen for this study

Data collection were from a web-based survey using SLQ form, collected from 499 recruited leaders and 630 raters. All data analysis completed before approaching the next phase. Descriptive statistics and Pearson correlation served as the basis for analyzing the independent and dependent variables. One-way and two-way ANOVA test done. A significant difference was set to be (<em>p</em>&lt;0.05), and the authenticity of the participants included in the study (Beck, C. D., 2014, p.302-304).

Rate 3

<strong>Did the qualitative method are of good quality based on the standard of qualitative research?</strong>

Data collection were in-depth one-on-one audiotaped interviews, collected from 12 recruited participants from leader pool- phase. The interview included nine open-ended questions were pilot tested for clarity. The participants informed that the interview would be audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. The participants reviewed the transcripts of their interviews to clarify or expand their responses as needed. The qualitative data were explored and coded to help explain why these participants demonstrated exemplary servant leadership behavior. They reviewed the themes and codes to check for appropriateness. The validity or inference quality procedures used in this study included member checking, triangulation, and peer review (Beck, C. D., 2014, p.304).

Rate 3

<strong>Is the choice of the mixed methods design appropriate and justified?</strong>

A good method design is used to plan and implement the study. Beck, C. D., (2014) employed a mixed methods sequential explanatory design consisting of two distinct phases: Phase 1, a quantitative study, followed by Phase 2, a qualitative study in which interviews conducted and responses were coded and analyzed for possible themes (p.302). The mixed method design is fully described, including the decision for timing, priority, and mixing. Beck, C. D., (2014) included the two phases in his study, the quantitative survey collected data in the form of servant leadership questionnaire (SLQ), and the qualitative data were one-on-one audiotaped interviews (p. 302, 304). That indicates the initial quantitative components had the priority for addressing the study’s purpose and the quantitative phase of the study built to the qualitative phase to produce qualitative findings that help to explain quantitative results (Plano-Clark &amp; Creswell, 2015, p.396). Triangulation was used to analyze the quantitative and qualitative data to validate the findings of the data collected (Beck, C. D., 2014, p.302).

Rate 3

<strong>What were the results of the stud</strong><strong>y?</strong>

<span style="font-size: 1rem">The quantitative and qualitative components were explicitly merged, consistent with the overall mixed method design, and explicitly discussed at the end of the study. The study had four significant findings. First, the longer a leader is in a leadership role, the more frequent the servant leader behaviors. Second, those leaders who volunteer at least one hour per week demonstrate higher servant leader behaviors. Third, servant leaders influence others through building trusting relationships. Lastly, servant leaders demonstrate an altruistic mindset (Beck, C. D., 2014, p.304).</span>

Rate 3

<strong>Does the use of mixed methods produce a good understanding of the study’s purpose? Does the study use a rigorous application of mixed methods research to address the purpose?</strong>

The findings provide complete, valid and in-depth answers to the study’s research questions. The integrated findings go beyond what was learned and answered the research question. The exemplary servant leadership in this study emphasized different aspects of SL in regarding of altruistic calling, emotional healing, wisdom, persuasive mapping, and organizational stewardship. The four major findings and the themes that emerged from the data analysis lend support to the notion that there are characteristics, behaviors, and life experiences that predict a servant leader (Beck, C. D., 2014, p.307). Validity in a mixed methods study is defined “as the ability of the researcher to draw meaningful and accurate conclusions from all of the data in the study” (Creswell &amp; Plano Clark, 2007, p. 146).

The mixed method design is a good fit for the study’s research problem purpose. The quantitative and qualitative and diverse aspects of the study fit together in a logical way to address the study’s purpose.
