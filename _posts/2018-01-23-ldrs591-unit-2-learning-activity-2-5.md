I must admit that the amount of available information for possible research consideration is indeed scary! Thankfully, appropriate use of technology helps simplify the process to a very great extent, if you fully understand how the technology works. Thankfully, the videos have helped me understand this quite well. However, I still love the part where some videos said, “If you have questions, ask a librarian.” Phew! This makes me further appreciate the work of a librarian and how they may also support people who may find the search process uninteresting.

I believe all sources have something to contribute to the research depending on precisely what one is looking for. As such, I realize that I may need to consider almost all at some point. Our “old-fashioned” Google search and books would be perfect for introductory or general information and also for establishing the authority of the authors, where needed.

&nbsp;

EBSCO and related sources will prove invaluable for scholarly materials that can help one understand the current thinking from the review of literature from past authors. Thankfully again, the ability to use the AND, OR, NOT, Search History and others take away a lot of the burden. This goes without mentioning the role of Google Scholar.

&nbsp;

In the final analysis, the researcher still has the responsibility to ensure that all information sources used are credible, suitable and relevant to the research study. To achieve all these, the sources should be reviewed for the authority of the authors, how current the materials is, its purpose, content, publication type and whether it contains any bias or special interests applicable to its authors.

&nbsp;

The materials contained in the Unit 2 notes have help provide clarity on all these aspects which help in choosing reliable sources of information.
