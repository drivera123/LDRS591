<pre><code>I believe this article ranks a three in categories one to five on page 301 of the Plano-Clark and Crewel text (2015). Overall, I believe that the plan and execution of the study were well done. The design went well with their intent to generate a theory revolving servant leadership, “The philosophy, values, and characteristics of servant leadership are applicable to youth leadership development” (Bogdan &amp;amp; Biklen, 2007, p.18). In fact, there is even a section in the article dedicated to the research design and its explanation. Through this, it is shown that the design properly addressed the purpose. Interviews were held so as to give students a personal chance to show their potential servant leadership skills, “These focus groups were grade-level specific, with an intent that interviewees of the same group had similar experiences so that purposeful discussion could be achieved” (Bogdan &amp;amp; Biklen, 2007, p.20).
