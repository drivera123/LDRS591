The first research question (&#8220;RQ&#8221;) I identified comes from my interest in leadership and the relationship between leadership, non-profit organizations and businesses. The question I often wonder is whether a specific style of leadership is more effective in an organization that is not primarily concerned with profits, as opposed to a business where the focus is primarily on profits. As I learn more about transformational servant leadership I often think it is a leadership style most suitable for church ministry or non-profit ministry. Though I know it can be effective in businesses as well, I am curious whether it is less effective than it would be in an organization that is more altruistic in nature.

The second research question I have is in regards to how churches can best use sports as a discipleship tool. I often see &#8220;Floor Hockey Night&#8221; events at churches, and occasionally a church will have an entire team signed up in a soccer league. Sports has given me unique opportunities to meet and disciple people and I am curious how churches could incorporate sports into their &#8220;Discipleship Ministry&#8221; rather than seeing it as something separate. I know there are some churches who have used sports as outreach events. Researching the best way to do this is an interest of mine.

Lastly, as someone who cares deeply about ethical consumerism and the effects it has on people, the question I have is why ethical consumerism is not spoken about in the church. I view ethical consumerism &#8211; particularly in regards to coffee and clothes &#8211; as a way to love and care for people and the environment. I know very few Christians who care about where their clothes or coffee is made, even though we all use clothes and most people I know drink coffee. There is a disconnect between &#8220;loving people&#8221; as Christians and ethical consumerism in the church and I am curious to know what the reasons are for this.

This last question is the strongest one, partially because it connects two of the things I care most about, namely, church ministry and ethical consumption. However, I also know that people, religious or not, are beginning to care more about ethical consumerism and thus there is more awareness and research being done on the topic. Learning more about when and how we as consumers in North America stopped knowing the origins of our purchases is something that would be enlightening.

The fields that would inform my research question would be religion, business, and history. Understanding the history of consumerism and how this affected businesses and their approach to buying and selling products would be a major point of research. Likewise, understanding how churches can begin to make people aware of ethical consumption and incorporate it into their ministry would be a point of research.
