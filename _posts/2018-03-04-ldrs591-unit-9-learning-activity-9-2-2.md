The following is my evaluation of the conclusions in the study by Barbuto, Gottfredson, &amp; Searle (2014). I performed the evaluation by applying criteria provided by Plano-Clark &amp; Creswell (2015, pp. 476-477).

<h5></h5>

<h5><strong>The major results were identified and summarized</strong></h5>

<strong> Rating – 3/3</strong>

The key finding was stated; emotional intelligence could be used to predict if a leader would adopt a servant-leader ideology but not the leader’s actual servant-leader behaviors. It was articulated in relation to the research questions and hypothesis. (p. 321). Lastly, no new results were introduced in the conclusions.

&nbsp;

<strong> </strong>

<h5><strong>The results were thoughtfully examined in relation to the literature and personal reflections </strong></h5>

<strong>Rating – 2/3</strong>

The key finding showed similarities to a prior research by Harms &amp; Crede (2010); emotional intelligence (EI) was found to show significant relationships with self-rated leadership but not with other’s leadership ratings. (p. 312). It also compared with predictions in the study.

When describing why EI may be a predictor of a leader’s ideology but not their behaviors, the reasons stated were not supported by any literature (p. 321); they appear to be personal reflections of the authors. I believe personal reflections are unnecessary in a quantitative study.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<h5><strong>Appropriate implications of the results for practice are identified and justified</strong></h5>

<strong>Rating – 3/3</strong>

The recommendations were based on the key findings; the author’s recommended that EI should be used as a criterion for selecting leaders in organizations seeking to hire leaders inclined to lead with a servant-leader ideology. (p. 322).

This describes an implication of the findings for practice, and, the audience that might benefit from the findings.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<h5><strong>Thoughtful critiques of the study’s limitations are provided and appropriate for the research approach</strong></h5>

<strong>Rating – 3/3</strong>

The study emphasized quantitative procedures. It provided limitations pertaining to the quality of measure, confounding variables, and, the representativeness of the sampling. (p. 321). These limitations, put in the same order as earlier presented are; common method bias, low group-mean reliability of follower-rated servant leadership, and, the use of a unique sample.

<strong> </strong><strong> </strong>

&nbsp;

<h5><strong>Suitable implications of the results for future research are identified and justified</strong></h5>

<strong>Rating – 3/3</strong>

Suggestions for future research were all based on the identified results and limitations. One suggestion was that future research should be conducted in the private sector to replicate and generalize findings. This was linked to the limitation that a random sample was not used in the study. (p. 322).

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<h5><strong>The interpretations are consistent with the study</strong></h5>

<strong>Rating – 3/3</strong>

I agree that the conclusions reached logically addressed the study’s purpose and research questions, and, were not beyond the limits of the study procedures.

<strong> </strong><strong> </strong>

&nbsp;

<h5><strong>The back matter is appropriate for the study report</strong></h5>

<strong>Rating – 3/3</strong>

Both the references and author notes present, were accurate, and contained information relevant to the study.
