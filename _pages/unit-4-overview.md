### Overview

In unit 4 we are going to find out about research reports. To start,  we will focus on understanding the common elements found in the introduction of research reports. We will be engaging with the research problem, the review of precedent literature, and the research purpose. Although the terms “research problem” and “research purpose” sound similar, we will see that although related, they are quite different.

### Learning Objectives

1. Distinguish the three common elements in the introductions of research reports.
2. Differentiate between a research problem statement and the purpose of a study.
3. Evaluate the elements of a problem statement, literature review and purpose.
4. Appraise types of research problems for suitability to quantitative or qualitative studies.
5. Examine the elements that comprise quantitative research questions \(research questions and hypotheses\) and qualitative research questions \(the central phenomenon\).
6. Contrast the purposes of the literature review from the perspectives of a research investigator \(scholarship of discovery\) and research consumer \(scholarship of application/integration/teaching\).
