This course is what has become known as a <em>connected course</em>. This means that there is a structure to the course which is different from standard online courses.

There are three key components to a connected course: Moodle, the <em>course hub</em>, and your own site.

<h5>Moodle</h5>

At the beginning of your course, your instructor likely alerted you to the course site in Moodle, which is at <a href="https://learn.twu.ca">learn.twu.ca</a>. Moodle is where some course activities may take place, where you can send and receive confidential messages, and access the discussion forums, which are only accessible to registered students.

If you need assistance with Moodle, please see our <a href="https://trinitywestern.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/KB/Default?CategoryID=4592">Knowledge Base articles here</a>.

<h5>Course Hub</h5>

The page that you are reading right now is hosted on a website in our digital learning environment in a tool called WordPress. This website is the <em>course hub</em>. You will come here for updates from your instructor, to find out what your learning activities and assessments will be for the course, and also to read what your colleagues are writing in response to the prompts in the course. You might want to bookmark the course hub page, as you will visit there often.

The course hub is open and available to the general public and some of your work will be seen here, so please be careful what you post.

<h6>How to find your content.</h6>

<h5>Course Participant Sites</h5>

Each participant in the course will have control over their own personal website, also hosted in WordPress (although other options may also work). Some of your work will take place on your own site and be published to the web. While we encourage you to publicize your work, there may be very good reasons for you to either work under a pseudonym or to keep your work private using the settings on your own site.

In order to participate in the course, you must submit the URL for your site to your instructor. Your instructor will then connect your site with the course hub through RSS (Really Simple Syndication). Once your site is connected through RSS, your posts on your own site will be syndicated and show up on the course hub.
