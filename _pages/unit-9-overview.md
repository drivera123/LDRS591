### Conclusions of Research Reports

### Overview

In unit 9 we focus on assessing and interpreting the discussion/conclusion section of a research report. The discussion section is where loose threads are gathered together, and in particular, the author looks backward and distills into a few succinct paragraphs what the particular research has accomplished. All significant aspects of the research report are brought together in proper perspective, including relating the findings or results to the conclusions. Above all, a good discussion makes explicit how the findings or results support the conclusions.

### Learning Objectives

1. Identify common elements in the discussion/conclusion section of research reports.
2. Assess the rigour and interpret the discussion/conclusion of research reports.
3. Compare the similarities and differences in the discussion/conclusion section of a qualitative and quantitative research report.
4. Evaluate the quality of the final sections of a research report.
